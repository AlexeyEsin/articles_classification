      "title": "‘Yellowstone’ is ending soon, but the Western appeal rides on",
      "text": "“Yellowstone” will wrangle up its story this fall as the Paramount Network’s darling Western drama is coming to an end. But that doesn’t mean the show’s world is being put out to pasture.Kevin Costner’s final run of episodes will conclude the dream run for the show, which drew 12.1 million viewers for its Season 5 premiere — more than any other scripted series last fall.But with the endgame comes questions about how the show will end and what’s coming next in the “Yellowstone” universe.“It’s foolishness,\" said Craig Johnson, author of the 19-book “Longmire” western mystery novel, which had its own television show from 2012 to 2017.“It’s just too broad of a subject matter to think you can just kill it off with one movie or one television series,” he said in a phone interview from his own Wyoming ranch. “It’s going to continue going on and on.”“It’s a part of our heritage. It’s always going to be there.\"“When I was watching the show for the first time, I could not have even imagined some of the insane storylines that would be going on but they all fit perfectly,” said Melissa Brouillette, a 29-year-old communications account manager in Boston.“Yellowstone” centers on the fictional Dutton family. Costner plays the patriarch John Dutton, who is doing anything he can to hold on to his ranch located near the Yellowstone National Park. The show, which has aired for five seasons, has a mix of political and family drama, and plotlines that talk about the state of America.Paramount has not announced how many episodes will be released this fall to wrap up the series. And it’s unclear if Costner will even return. Multiple reports suggested Costner may want to leave the series ahead of its final round of episodes, which haven’t been filmed yet. Paramount did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson told the Associated Press that “Kevin Costner is a big part of ‘Yellowstone’ and we hope that’s the case for a long time to come.”But the Dutton family’s decision to lock up the ranch “is probably the right choice to make,” Brouillette said. “It would be hard to try to continue on without the main character and it will always feel like there is some sort of hole they are constantly trying to fill,” she said.Paramount has already planted seeds for expansion. Since the success of “Yellowstone,” the network has built out its own “Yellowstone” television universe with multiple shows and spinoffs stewarded by co-creator Taylor Sheridan.There are two “Yellowstone” prequel series on Paramount Plus already, “1883” and “1923.” The former shows the history of the Dutton family as they travel from Texas to Montana, while the latter follows the events of “1883” and shows the Dutton family running a farm along with their children while facing challenges of the early 20th century.The network is mapping out a future as well. A new sequel series is on the way, and it is expected to air in December. Rumors are speculating that Matthew McConaughey will star in the new project. Paramount has denied those reports. A spokesperson told the AP that McConaughey “is a phenomenal talent with whom we’d love to partner.”Sheridan has another series on the way called “Lawmen: Bass Reeves.” It was originally titled “1883: The Bass Reeves Story” before it was shortened to just “Bass Reeves.” It is based on a true story of the first black U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi River.And then there’s the long-rumored “6666” series — pronounced “Four Sixes” — which tells the story of a specific ranch named, well, “6666.” The premiere date remains unclear. McConaughey is rumored to join this series, too, but it’s unclear if this is the same sequel series.Brouillette said she plans to stick with the “Yellowstone” franchise and its new projects. The prequels left her hooked as much as the original show did so there’s no reason to give up now.“This new show will be no different and I will definitely be tuning in on premiere day to watch,” she said. “Besides, who doesn’t love Matthew McConaughey?”",

      "title": "Advice | Miss Manners: Elders ask for grace around new names and pronouns ",
      "text": "Dear Miss Manners: Thank you for addressing the issue of “intent to offend” as opposed to being slow to adapt to newly identified verbiage. The issue our family is experiencing relates to pronoun identity.I have a family member who has declared they/them pronouns, along with a change to their given name, in the last year. The elderly members of our family are respectful of this. We do, however, make verbal slips, both with the new name and pronoun. We aren’t intentionally using the wrong ones, but it’s a process, especially since we don’t see them but twice a year.The issue: If we slip up and don’t correct ourselves immediately, the conversation becomes a battle. They will either aggressively correct the offender or refuse to respond, and the conversation is hijacked.I don’t want to be disrespectful, but I have found myself hesitant to converse with them because it has the risk of major sidetracking and drama (crying and shouting). I have asked them for grace in the transition, but it seems they are so focused on the way they want to be addressed that they aren’t thinking of it as a two-way street.The person is a minor, but their parent allows this aggressive approach to “prevent them from being disrespected.” What are your thoughts?That they do not mind being disrespectful of their elderly relatives who are trying to respect them. Collecting insults and taking offense when obviously none was intended have become national sports.You say that you and your fellow elders are supportive but occasionally forgetful. Miss Manners would consider it a sign of maturity for the child to let this go with a mere eye roll, and to muster the patience to keep issuing polite reminders.That approach would go a long way in making family life pleasant. Let us hope that your relative can be mature enough to understand that.Dear Miss Manners: Is there a proper way to eat haricots verts when dining out? I had lunch with a friend and we were both served haricots verts. I speared the whole bean with a fork and took a couple of bites to finish it. She cut hers with a knife and fork. Who was right?We are talking green beans here — long, thin, French ones. (Considering the number of people who think “RSVP” is a noun, Miss Manners is not going to trust that everyone passed high school French.)Ice cream cone style is wrong here, so your friend was closer to being correct. But if the beans were properly cooked, you should have been able to cut them with the side of your fork.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

      "title": "Advice | Carolyn Hax: A month post-wedding, her in-laws push for grandkids",
      "text": "Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: I’ve been married for less than two months, and my in-laws are already sniffing around, wondering when there will be a grandchild. We plan to start trying soon, but not immediately, for reasons that are none of their business. I don’t want to be a total killjoy or start off on a bad foot with them. How do I establish some boundaries around this, and also not feel like I’m just a walking vessel for their hoped-for grandchild?— Pressured to ProcreatePressured to Procreate: I don’t know, I’d be more inclined to surrender to the feeling and accept the fact of their seeing me as grandchild vessel. Going with the current is always easier. Plus, it says nothing about you and your worthiness as a human; it’s 100 percent a statement about their myopia. They’ve lost their minds perspective and you can anticipate/pity/forgive them accordingly.And hey, at least they are not so hostile to your presence in their family that they’re anti-grandchild! I know could-be-worse-isms rarely help, but this one feels worse enough to warrant a mention.As for the boundaries, their inappropriate lobbying presents you with fine opportunities for the one-two combination of direct-but-kind comment plus pointed repetition.1: “I understand you’re interested in grandchildren, but I would be grateful for some privacy. Thank you so much.”2 through infinity: Whatever you want to say, as long as it’s not mean-spirited and as long as you repeat it verbatim. For example, “No news is no news.” Or, “You know how I feel about this.” Or, “Bless your heart.” Or, [gentle pat-pat to in-law’s arm, smile, change subject/leave room]. Or, “[Husband], it’s for you.” Or, “Remember, no uterus talk.” Whatever you can see yourself saying. Over and over, to create the brick wall they may eventually notice they’re not getting through.Re: Vessel: A former colleague came up with (I thought) a very clever solution. After an annoying number of inquiries, she and her spouse told the in-laws once: “We hope and plan to have children, three-ish years from now. We are letting you know, so you don’t have to ask anymore. Each time you do, we will push it back one month.”No one ever asked again.— AnonymousAnonymous: That’s got some vigilante energy, thanks.Other readers’ thoughts:· When my husband and I got engaged, my mother-in-law threw a family party where, in the blessing she gave before eating, she blessed my womb. Walking vessel, indeed.· At my wedding reception, my new sister-in-law put her hands on my stomach, above my uterus, and started praying over it. Our relationship has not improved.Dear Carolyn: How do I help a spouse with depression? It’s coming out as anger, and he’s having a hard time understanding and listening to our neurodivergent children. I want to help him, but I also don’t want him to yell at them anymore.— SpouseSpouse: Insist on formal medical treatment of the depression, plus counseling. Nonnegotiable. I am sorry. You need to protect those kids.I urge counseling for you, too, with a therapist who works with children and families, and with neurodivergence, so you can eventually bring family members into the sessions with you. If money and access are a problem, then look for online parenting support keyed to your kids’ diagnoses. Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (chadd.org), for example, offers ADHD-related support. The frustration alone can push families apart, so understanding and anticipating behaviors is helpful not only with responding to them productively, but also with keeping families (and their sanities) intact.From the archive:Bringing non-family on family vacations?

      "title": "An American expat raised a family in Australia. He was hiding a dark secret.",
      "text": "Unaware of their father’s secret, the children of John Vincent Damon knew him as a successful businessman and a loving parent — a quiet, reserved loner who once told his daughter that he ached to reveal so much more about his life.He never did. Damon died in 2010 in his adopted homeland of Australia, taking his secret to the grave.Last week, the U.S. Marshals Service resurrected it, announcing that investigators had discovered that Damon wasn’t really Damon at all, but William Leslie Arnold, a prisoner who’d escaped the Nebraska State Penitentiary in 1967 while serving a double life sentence for murdering his parents when he was 16. For more than a half-century, Arnold eluded authorities, including for over a decade after his death, the Marshals said in a news release. As Damon, he built a new life, marrying twice, fathering two children and eventually moving halfway around the world to Australia, where he became a successful salesman. He died in 2010 at the age of 67.But after investigators struck out on finding Arnold for more than 50 years, a deputy U.S. Marshal in Omaha, armed with DNA from Arnold’s brother, turned to genetic genealogy. The relatively new technology was made famous in 2018 when it was used to find and arrest Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., dubbed the Golden State Killer.Matthew Westover, the deputy U.S. Marshal who inherited the cold case in 2020, didn’t immediately get any useful hits on people possibly related to Arnold. And so he waited, hoping one of Arnold’s descendants would get curious about their ancestry, submit their DNA to a public genealogy database and pop up on his radar.In 1958, at the age of 16, Arnold shot his parents in their dining room because they’d refused to let him take a girl to the drive-in, the Omaha World-Herald reported. After burying them in the backyard, he lived in his family home for the next two weeks as if nothing had happened, attending school, going to church and even opening his father’s business, staving off questions by telling people his parents had left town to visit his grandparents, Westover said.Then, his charade collapsed when the grandparents came to town looking for Arnold’s mother and father, he added. When police eventually came to the house, Arnold pointed out to officers where he had buried his parents, and they soon dug up the bodies, according to the World-Herald. The following year, he pleaded guilty to the murders and was given two life sentences, the U.S. Marshals said in the release.For the next eight years, Arnold was a “model prisoner,” according to the release. But on July 14, 1967, he and another inmate escaped, fleeing to Chicago, where they went their separate ways. While the other fugitive was captured, Arnold eluded the manhunt. And he continued to do so as days turned to weeks, months and then years. The FBI worked the case into the 1990s before handing it back to Nebraska prison officials, who eventually relayed it to the U.S. Marshals.The case stalled and was passed down as people retired or left for other jobs. Westover, who joined the Marshals in 2015, took it over in August 2020 “basically as a joke.” But it piqued his interest.Westover started Googling and came across the World-Herald’s 2017 series about the Arnold case. He spent the next hour devouring it and then poring over fringe theories internet sleuths had cooked up about Arnold’s whereabouts.“I just kind of became hooked,” he said.Identifying genetic genealogy as the most promising investigative tool, Westover and another deputy traveled to Missouri to collect a DNA sample from Arnold’s brother and got his permission to submit it to a genetic genealogy service. Westover did that in late 2020, making himself the point of contact for anyone seeking more information about the brother’s DNA. There were immediate hits, but they were known relatives that Westover had investigated already.And so he waited while pursuing other leads, none of which panned out.Then, on Aug. 9, 2022, he received an update. There was a new hit.Westover checked it out and said he was ecstatic. Judging by how much DNA this person shared with Arnold, Westover figured he had found Arnold’s son. The person who had uploaded his DNA into the registry also sent messages to Westover, thinking he was the source of the DNA and possibly a relative. The man told Westover he was trying to find out more about his father, who was an orphan originally from Chicago.One word stuck out: orphan.“I was like, ‘Game, set, match.’ I knew 100 percent this was going to be our guy,” Westover said.Over the next couple of weeks, Westover, who still hadn’t revealed himself as a law enforcement officer, played coy. He wanted to confirm that the beloved father known as John Damon was, in fact, Arnold. He also wanted to secure proof that Arnold was dead before revealing himself as a U.S. Marshal and possibly giving Arnold a chance to bolt.Eventually, Westover got official records confirming that Damon was dead. On Aug. 24, Westover got on a video call with Arnold’s son and his wife to break the news: He was a federal law enforcement officer hunting his father, who had murdered his parents and spent more than 40 years on the lam.The son took it hard.“It was difficult for me as well just seeing the pure emotion and seeing this guy be told basically his dad is a murderer that escaped prison,” Westover said. “I can’t imagine how tough that would have been.”Westover learned that Arnold became Damon almost immediately after his escape. As Damon, he married a single mother with four daughters in Chicago. The couple eventually became estranged. Damon moved to California, divorced his wife, remarried and had two children before moving abroad with his new family in the early 1990s, first to New Zealand and then to Australia.Over the next 15 years or so, Arnold built a new life as Damon. He became a successful salesman, traveling often for work. He raised his two children and stayed with his second wife until he died.In March, Westover flew to Australia to meet with Arnold’s son. He visited Damon’s grave in Queensland, where he took a photograph of the headstone, bookending it with his U.S. Marshal’s badge on one side and Arnold’s wanted poster on the other.He also got an official sample of the son’s DNA, which, when compared to Arnold’s brother’s, would prove that Damon was Arnold.With that, Westover closed the case.",

      "title": "She wrote a kids’ book on grief — then was charged with killing her husband ",
      "text": "When she published a children’s book almost a year after her husband’s death, Kouri Richins wanted to help kids struggling to cope with the loss of a loved one. The Utah mother of three was facing her own grief when she wrote the picture book after her husband, Eric Richins, died in March 2022, she said.“It completely took us all by shock,” Richins said in April while promoting her book, “Are You With Me?” In an interview with KTVX, an ABC affiliate in Salt Lake City, she added: “It’s — you know — explaining to my kid just because he’s not present here with us physically, doesn’t mean his presence isn’t here with us.”But after a month of praise from local media for helping children deal with grief, Richins’s story took a dark turn. She has been charged with her husband’s murder, accused of poisoning him with a lethal dose of fentanyl.Richins, 33, was arrested Monday and charged with aggravated murder, a first-degree felony, and three counts of second-degree felony possession with intent to distribute, according to the Summit County Sheriff’s Office.Richins initially told police that she had made her husband a mixed vodka drink and that he consumed a THC gummy as the couple celebrated his sale of a home, according to charging documents obtained by The Washington Post. She told police that she later found her 39-year-old husband unresponsive and “cold to the touch” before he was pronounced dead, charging documents say.But a toxicology report from the Utah Medical Examiner’s Office concluded that Eric Richins “died from an overdose of fentanyl,” according to charging documents unsealed Monday.“The level of fentanyl in Eric’s system was approximately five times the lethal dosage,” the medical examiner wrote.The murder charge stems from police investigators’ interactions with Kouri Richins as well as the account of an “unnamed acquaintance” who claims to have sold her the fentanyl, according to authorities. If convicted, Richins faces 25 years to life in prison.Skye Lazaro, Richins’s attorney, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning.Margaret Olson, one of the prosecutors in the case for the Summit County Attorney’s Office, stressed that Richins is “presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” She declined to comment on the charges.“Please keep in mind there are three young children belonging to the decedent and the accused, making this matter very sensitive and difficult,” Olson told The Post on Tuesday.The charges in Utah come less than four years after an author in Portland, Ore., wrote about “how to murder your husband” — and was convicted of murdering her husband. Romance novelist Nancy Crampton Brophy fatally shot her husband, 63-year-old chef Daniel Brophy, at the Oregon Culinary Institute on June 2, 2018. Crampton Brophy, who was sentenced to life in prison last year, had published an essay in 2011 describing five core motives and a number of murder weapons from which she would choose if her character were to kill a husband in a romance novel.Novelist who wrote about ‘How to Murder Your Husband’ charged with murdering her husbandKouri and Eric Richins were married nine years and had three sons — Carter, Ashton and Weston, who were 9, 7 and 5 years old at the time of his death — according to his obituary.“Eric was a family man, who always strove to be the absolute best father and husband,” his obituary reads. “Eric did absolutely everything in his power to provide his family with every possible opportunity to learn, grow, and have fun.”But the couple was not in a good place in early 2022, authorities say.An unsealed warrant states that Kouri Richins had logged into the joint life insurance policy her husband had with his business partner at C & E Stone Masonry in January 2022. She removed them as each other’s beneficiary and named herself as the policy’s sole beneficiary, the warrant says. Eric Richins and his business partner were able to change it back after the insurance company notified them of the change, authorities say.Around this same time, Kouri Richins, a real estate agent, had been in contact with an acquaintance about obtaining prescription pain medication for an investor, charging documents say. The acquaintance, who is identified by authorities only as C.L., said Richins made multiple requests for pain medications. C.L. said Richins specifically asked for fentanyl, prosecutors say, and requested “some of the Michael Jackson stuff” as well. After C.L. obtained about 15 to 30 fentanyl pills from a dealer in Ogden, Ore., Richins purchased them for $900, according to the charging documents.On Feb. 14, 2022, Kouri and Eric Richins were having a Valentine’s Day dinner at their home in Kamas, Utah, when the husband “became very ill” shortly after they had eaten, authorities say. He believed he had been poisoned — and allegedly had an idea of who might have done it.“Eric told a friend that he thought his wife was trying to poison him,” prosecutors say.About two weeks later, Kouri Richins asked for another $900 worth of fentanyl pills, which she received from C.L. at one of the homes she was showing on Feb. 26, 2022, authorities say.Unbeknown to Richins, her husband had replaced her as the beneficiary of his will and his power of attorney, the warrant says. He did not tell his wife that he replaced her with his sister in the will because he believed his wife might “kill him for the money,” his sisters told authorities.One of his sisters recalled to authorities how Eric Richins had called them years earlier while he and his wife were vacationing in Greece to say he had become violently ill after he had an alcoholic drink that Kouri Richins handed him. The sister alleged that Eric Richins believed then that his wife had tried to kill him, the warrant says.“He warned them that if anything happened to him, she was to blame,” the warrant reads.The charging documents do not explain why he had stayed with his wife if he believed she had tried to poison him.On March 3, 2022, Kouri Richins said she and her husband were celebrating closing on a $2 million house to be used for her business. Family members have disputed this, telling authorities that Eric Richins was going to tell her they weren’t buying the home, charging documents say.About 9 p.m., Kouri Richins said, according to the documents, “she made Eric a Moscow Mule in the kitchen and brought it to their bedroom where Eric consumed it while sitting in bed.” After he fell asleep following a night terror, she told authorities, she went to the bedroom of one of her children.At 3 a.m., she returned to her bedroom, she told investigators.“She felt Eric and he was cold to the touch,” prosecutors say. “That is when [the] defendant called 911.”After he was pronounced dead, Richins told police that she had kept her phone plugged in next to her bed and did not take it into the other bedroom. But investigators say they later found that the phone had been locked and unlocked multiple times and that messages were sent, received and deleted during that time.As his death was being investigated, Richins posted photos to social media remembering her husband.When she was reading her children bedtime stories, she found that nights were the hardest for her sons and wanted a book that addressed some of the feelings of grief they were processing, she told local media. That’s when she decided to write and self-publish a children’s book to help others deal with grief.“I just wanted some story to read to my kids at night, and I just could not find anything,” she told KTVX.The 41-page book released March 7 is described on its Amazon page as “a must-read for any child who has experienced the pain of loss, and for parents who want to provide their children with the emotional support they need to heal and grow.” Richins’s book is based on what she calls the three C’s: connection, continuity and care.“It’s just comforting to them to know that they’re not living this life alone,” Richins said last month. “Dad is still here — it’s just in a different way.”She told KPCW, an NPR affiliate in Salt Lake City, that there were plans for sequels, including her next title, “Mom, How Far Away is Heaven?” Her first book “Are You With Me?” had surged into the top 5,000 of Amazon’s top books list as of Tuesday morning. Later in the day, it appeared Amazon removed the book from its website.A detention hearing to decide whether the mother should be held in jail is scheduled for May 19, according to KPCW.Eric Richins was remembered as an avid outdoorsman and hunter who spoke Spanish fluently after a two-year mission to Mexico City for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, his obituary says. Above all, the University of Utah graduate “lived to the fullest and with few regrets,” according to his family.“Words can’t describe the loneliness and loss that is felt in every heart that was lucky enough to know him,” the obituary says.Before she was arrested, Richins posted a video reel to Facebook saying how much she missed the late husband she is now accused of poisoning.“Life is just so … hard without you here!” she wrote. “The cards I have been dealt seems like a game that just can’t be played.”",

      "title": "Advice | Ask Elaine: My daughter cut me off and won’t say why. What should I do?",
      "text": "Hi Elaine: I’m at the airport after a second failed attempt to repair my relationship with my 21-year-old daughter. I flew from the East Coast to California for the second year and she still won’t meet with me. I was hospitalized for depression and didn’t see my daughter during that period but we did communicate. When I asked to visit her, she suddenly went silent. No email, nothing. Well, actually she sends a birthday card every year. The card this year had a friendly message, but it’s a strange kind of distant communication. She won’t respond to any attempt to actually have an exchange. I flew here and requested by text just to have a conversation. I got nothing. I’ve been here for three days, and now I’m going home deeply disappointed.I've apologized for anything I might have done countless times and begged her to tell me what the issue is. I get no reply. The problem has been ongoing, even before I was hospitalized.I just don’t know what the problem is, and she won’t tell me. I love her. The relationship is one of the most important things in my life. I’m 71 and don’t want to waste precious time.— Sad DadSad Dad: This is a hard one. You feel like you’ve done all you can to reconcile with your daughter but it sounds like the harder you try, the more she recoils. In the absence of an explanation, you have to respect the truth behind her actions. She clearly isn’t ready to re-engage. As a parent to an adult, all you can do is give her space and time. It takes two to rebuild a relationship, and the only person in this relationship you can control is you.It’s okay to reach out to keep the lines of communication open from your end but it’s best to choose methods that honor her boundaries and give her the space to decide how she wants to respond. Stick to text or sending cards in the mail vs. calling or showing up in her city.There is clearly a reason for her distance. That reason could have everything to do with you, or nothing at all. The unknowing is the hardest part. I can only imagine how much time you’ve spent replaying scenarios, searching your mind for reasons and ways to fix this.People tend to isolate when they feel unsafe, resentful, hurt, or when they’re going through things they’re not ready to face. They stop communicating when they don’t know how to express their feelings or don’t see a path forward in the relationship.Resentment doesn’t form overnight. Your daughter may have complicated feelings about you and your relationship that run much deeper than you think. You were recently hospitalized for depression. Good on you for getting the help you need. Along with the mental health support you received, have you considered how your struggles over the years may have impacted your daughter?Your apology “for anything I might have done” sounds a bit generic. Apologies that lack specificity can come off as lacking true accountability, too, or even feel transactional — like, “I apologized and now you need to forgive me.” I’m curious if you have done the deep self reflection necessary to take inventory of how you may have hurt her? Have you offered her, not just a blanket apology, but a sincere and specific apology that details exactly what you are apologizing for? If not, start there. If you need help pinpointing what you should be apologizing for, seek help from a therapist or mutual loved ones who may have valuable insight that could help you see and understand your position differently.When you miss someone this much, it can be easier to fixate on your desire to have the relationship back rather than the work necessary to earn forgiveness and reentry into the relationship. Don’t let your yearning to have her back in your life override the focus on uncovering why she may not want you in hers.Avoid victimizing yourself. It’s a distraction. Feeling abandoned and shunned by your child without reason must be incredibly painful. You have every reason to be heartbroken. But be mindful of the narrative you’re telling yourself and others by limiting the energy you expend on centering your pain. You are the parent here and your number one priority should be making sure your daughter is safe and healthy first.Have a question for Elaine? Submit it here.This is painful to hear, but have you considered that she could be creating a boundary with you to maintain her own sense of psychological safety and equilibrium? This is not to suggest blame but rather to offer a lens of compassion for her plight in this complicated situation.This is all a lot to process and consider. I hope you are not navigating this alone. Stay close to your mental health support as you work through your grief. In the meantime, keep finding ways to let your daughter know you care and want to be there, while also honoring her boundaries. Even if it feels like your efforts are in vain, know that they matter. Because no matter what happens between you and your daughter, it’s important you go to bed at night knowing you’ve done everything in your power to repair the most important relationship in your life.

      "text": "A Louisiana man has been charged after police said he shot a 14-year-old girl in the back of the head after she had been playing hide-and-seek on his property.The shooting occurred Sunday morning in Starks, La., a rural town of fewer than 700 people near the border with Texas. Officers from the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office received reports of a shooting at a property there, the office said in a news release. When they arrived, they found the girl suffering from a gunshot wound. She was taken to a hospital with injuries that weren’t life-threatening, the release said.The release said children had been playing hide-and-seek in the area and hiding on David V. Doyle’s property. Doyle, 58, told officers he got his gun after seeing “shadows outside his home.”Doyle “then advised detectives he went back outside and observed people running away from his property, at which time he began shooting at them and unknowingly hit the girl,” according to the release.The incident is the latest in a string of U.S. shootings this year in which young people have been shot — some fatally — after mistakenly being in the wrong location.Police arrested Doyle and charged him with aggravated battery, four counts of aggravated assault with a firearm and illegal discharge of a firearm. He remained in custody Tuesday morning at the Calcasieu Correctional Center, with bond set at $300,000.Last month, four similar shootings occurred in one week.On April 13, Ralph Yarl was shot in the head by a homeowner in Kansas City, Mo., after he rang the doorbell, thinking it was the house where he was to pick up his younger twin brothers. Yarl, 16, was critically injured but survived.In wake of Ralph Yarl shooting, Black teens face fear and resignationTwo days later, a man shot and killed 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis after she and her friends mistakenly pulled into his driveway in the town of Hebron in Upstate New York. The group was looking for a friend’s house.Two young women also were shot in Texas — with one of them, 18-year-old Payton Washington, critically injured — after Washington got into the wrong car in a grocery store parking lot.On the same day, a man shot 6-year-old Kinsley White and her parents in Gastonia, N.C. Carolyn Hilderbrand, the girl’s grandmother, told The Washington Post that the shooter became enraged when a basketball that children were playing with rolled into his yard.Arrest made in shooting of 6-year-old girl, father in North CarolinaIn addition to gun violence affecting one, two or three victims, the United States has also logged more than 200 mass shootings this year — defined as incidents in which four or more people, not including the shooter, are injured or killed — according to a Washington Post tracker.Maham Javaid, Ellen Francis, Júlia Ledur, Timothy Bella and Rachel Hatzipanagos contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Advice | Ask Amy: How much financial support do I owe my sister?",
      "text": "Dear Amy: My question is about family obligations — both financial and emotional. My sister and I are both in our 70s and retired.She has made life choices that have left her alone and out of money with serious health issues. She has had multiple marriages that failed. She quit working at a young age (30s) because of health concerns. I believe our mother supported her for years before my mother’s death in 2003. We live 1,000 miles apart.She has children who live near her: one who has not had contact with her in a decade and one who helps only when she feels she has to.I have been married for more than 40 years; we both worked hard for decades and have a reasonable retirement that may or may not last as long as we live.My sister has often expressed how she needs money, without actually asking for it. I have given her about $1,000 this past year. I send cash gifts for holidays and birthdays, but I’m sure that is nowhere near what she needs.She has recently asked me to exit her life because of “lack of support.” She has never been a kind person.I am looking for an objective answer as to what my support for her should be, if any. My last visit to see her was 10 years ago, and I have no desire to visit again.She has a social worker and gets some government help but still lives independently in an apartment that she can’t afford. Her children have never asked me for money. The one who does help her reluctantly is a high earner. The other one, not so much.I wonder how other families handle these situations. Any advice?— Sorry SisterSister: Other families handle this the way your family is: by wading through their confusion, guilt and sorrow — and by making choices they then doubt.In short, most families react to messy situations in messy ways. You are not obligated to help your sister — or anyone.But do you donate to causes that help needy strangers? And do the recipients of this help need to prove that they are worthy to receive your generosity? It might inspire you to put your sister in the category of someone who will never earn your help or (possibly) express gratitude for it. Will you help, anyway? It’s totally up to you.If you do choose to help, you will feel better if you do so from a place of compassion versus obligation. You should contact your sister’s daughter to ask for her perspective regarding her mother’s needs.I think it’s likely that this unkind and needy woman raised a daughter who is extremely careful with her own boundaries, and she would probably advise you to do the same.Dear Amy: Some relatives (who do not usually gather, except for reunions) are getting together for an almost week-long time together. Everyone has to fly to get there. A big house will be rented for the vacation. I had originally wanted to go, but, upon thinking and pondering this, it does not feel comfortable to me in my present state of mind.I’m not sure why, but that’s how I feel. The dates are in place, but nothing else has been decided. How can I gently decline when I originally thought this was a good/fun idea?— Reluctant TravelerReluctant: Before declining altogether, you should do your best to sort out your feelings. I believe for many people, experiencing the personal and social dislocation of the coronavirus pandemic has had a lingering effect of a sort of free-floating anxiety about leaving home.While it is extremely important for you to listen to your own instincts, it is also helpful to occasionally push through; sometimes showing up (even when you're unsure) can lead to positive experiences.If you do decide to decline — keep it simple. Just say, “I think this sounds like a really fun time. Thank you for putting it together. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to make it this year, but I hope everyone has a great time.”Dear Amy: “Confused” was disenchanted with her marriage and contemplating a move with her minor daughter and retiring on “her” pension.In your response, you forgot to issue your usual sage advice to consult a lawyer. She might be shocked to discover that her pension may be considered a marital asset, divisible in a divorce.— Concerned ReaderReader: Absolutely! Thank you.© 2023 by Amy Dickinson.

      "title": "Analysis | Trump tests how insulated his base is from the Carroll verdict reality",
      "text": "With the obvious exception of the celebrity of the defendant, the civil trial Donald Trump faced in New York unfolded as any other such trial might. There was evidence, there were depositions. Each side offered an opening statement. The attorney for the plaintiff, writer E. Jean Carroll, called witnesses and Trump’s attorney, Joe Tacopina, cross-examined them.Tacopina did decide against presenting his own witnesses, a not-unheard-of tactic aimed in part at suggesting to the jury that the case against the defendant was weak enough to require no additional response. In retrospect, that may have been an error; on Tuesday afternoon, the jury returned a verdict finding Trump liable in defaming Carroll in response to her allegation that he’d groped her in a Manhattan department store.The jury also determined that sufficient evidence existed to determine that the assault had actually occurred. Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThe trial is over, but the political battle Trump faces is not. For months, he’s worked to squeeze the Carroll lawsuit into the large box holding all of his other legal threats, casting it as yet another effort by the left or the elites or the whoevers to block his political ascent and, by doing so, to render his supporters themselves inert.As has been the case since he first cobbled together his “witch hunt” defense in response to reports about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump offered a steady stream of misinformation to his social-media followers and supporters framing the lawsuit as biased, unfair and un-American. As the trial reached its conclusion, Trump began making noises about taking the stand, rebutting Carroll’s claims from within the courtroom.While he was in Ireland last week, he pledged to do exactly that.“I’m going to go back and confront this woman,” he told reporters. “This woman is a disgrace, and it shouldn’t be allowed in this country.”There is no reason that this would appeal to Tacopina. If Trump took the stand, he would open himself to cross-examination from Carroll’s attorney — a real-time, under-oath opportunity to pick apart his claims and allegations. Tacopina appeared to let slip his frustration with his client; speaking during a sidebar with the judge last week, he reportedly told the judge Trump wasn’t going to show up.“I know you understand what I am dealing with,” Tacopina told the judge.Trump in fact did not testify. So how did he spin it?“Waiting for a jury decision on a False Accusation where I, despite being a current political candidate and leading all others in both parties, am not allowed to speak or defend myself, even as hard nosed reporters scream questions about this case at me,” Trump said on Truth Social. “In the meantime, the other side has a book falsely accusing me of Rape, & is working with the press. I will therefore not speak until after the trial, but will appeal the Unconstitutional silencing of me, as a candidate, no matter the outcome!”You’ll notice that this statement isn’t itself consistent: he is choosing not to speak until after the trial, but also he’s being “unconstitutionally silenced”? He’s “not allowed to speak or defend himself” but was going to “confront” Carroll?You will also notice that it is obviously not true. He could have taken the stand if he wanted, perhaps giving Tacopina a coronary in the process. What’s more, he did speak — in a lengthy deposition where he, lawyer at his side, answered various questions posed by Carroll’s attorney, getting in any number of digs about the lawsuit and his opponents. Had he taken the stand, he’d have had the chance to present his case — but also faced interruptions from Carroll’s attorney and, later, a cross-examination that benefited from having his deposition responses and rhetoric in-hand.How weak is this argument about being silenced? Even Fox News — as part of a lengthy exploration of the failure the verdict constituted for Trump — rejected the idea that this “silencing” would be the heart of his appeal.“He was asked if he wanted to testify in person here and he declined, correct?” Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum asked legal commentator — and constant Trump defender — Jonathan Turley.“Yeah, that dog won’t hunt,” Turley replied. “If that’s the argument on appeal, then it’s going to be a rather quick appeal.”That probably won’t be the argument on appeal. A statement sent to reporters by the Trump campaign didn’t include any allegation about being silenced, focusing instead on how “this entire bogus case is a political endeavor targeting President Trump because he is now an overwhelming front-runner to be once again elected President of the United States.”Again, though, there is a difference between what Trump says and what his campaign says, just as there’s a difference between what Trump says and his attorney said. For Trump, it’s more useful to tell his social-media audience that the leftist elites are illegally muffling him than to suggest that the case was lost on the merits. It’s more useful, in part, because his core base of support has demonstrated repeatedly over the past eight years that they prefer his formulation of events to those of his opponents or to that crafted by reality.Fox News isn’t biting. But maybe his fans will, and that’s good enough.",

      "title": "Texas House expels GOP lawmaker over sexual misconduct allegations",
      "text": "The Texas House of Representatives voted 147-0 on Tuesday to expel state Rep. Bryan Slaton (R) from its ranks after a committee recommended his dismissal over allegations of sexual misconduct with a 19-year-old aide.Slaton resigned from his seat Monday, a day ahead of the vote. Legislative staffers brought a ladder to the House floor Tuesday to remove his name from the voting roll. Calls to Slaton’s campaign office were not answered.The Texas House last expelled a legislator in 1927, for bribery charges.The House’s general investigating committee released a report Saturday that accused Slaton, 45, of engaging in disorderly conduct — including harassment, serving alcohol to someone underage and abusing his position. The investigation was launched in April after a 21-year-old legislative intern and two 19-year-old aides filed complaints accusing Slaton of sexual harassment and retaliation.The five-person bipartisan committee found that Slaton “engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a subordinate,” Rep. Andrew Murr (R), the investigating committee’s chair, said on the floor Saturday.Facing expulsion vote over sexual misconduct, GOP lawmaker resigns in TexasIn the debate preceding the Tuesday vote to expel Slaton, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle condemned his behavior, with Murr saying his former colleague’s conduct does not meet “the minimum standards of conduct expected from a member” of the Texas House.“No one in this chamber disagrees that this conduct was wrong,” Murr said. “We all agree that it cannot and will not be tolerated.”In a resignation letter sent Monday to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), Slaton did not mention the allegations against him, which he has denied. He wrote that he was looking forward to “spending more time with my young family.”The legislative aides and intern who accused Slaton of wrongdoing said he’d helped them get alcohol multiple times, according to the committee’s report. One aide had been hired by the Republican lawmaker in January, the report states. The other two women worked in a different office.Before midnight on March 31, Slaton invited the aide who worked in his office to his Austin condo, and three friends joined her to offer protection, the report states. Slaton poured the aide rum and coke until her vision was blurred and she felt “really dizzy,” according to the report. The aide stayed at Slaton’s condo when her friends left around 2 a.m., the report says.The aide told investigators that alcohol hindered her judgment, “but now that I look back at it, it was definitely an inappropriate situation,” according to the report. She declined to tell investigators what sexual activity occurred or whether she provided consent, the report states.The aide “could not effectively consent to intercourse and could not indicate whether it was welcome or unwelcome,” the report states.The aide’s friends told investigators that the next morning, the aide took the emergency contraceptive Plan B and was driven to her apartment by Slaton, the report says. She told her friends that she’d had sex with Slaton, according to the report.The next week, Slaton showed an email to the aide that claimed a staffer knew the pair were “sleeping” together and “nothing would happen as long as her and her friends keep quiet,” the report says. The aide and her friends felt threatened, the report says, and one told other members of the House about the events.Ahead of the vote, Texas state Rep. Ann Johnson (D) — who serves as vice chair of the general investigating committee — said it was important for the young adults who “found themselves” in Slaton’s apartment to know that they “never were and are not the problem.”“He is [the problem],” she said. “Our report shows that Bryan Slaton violated various provisions of our House rules and various Texas laws.”Johnson noted in her remarks that Slaton, who took office in January 2021, did not address the allegations in his resignation letter.“He’s not going to play the reformed man who’s atoning for his sins,” she said.Slaton, she said, “is not worthy of the position of trust, much less power.”",

      "title": "Analysis | Trump’s Fifth Avenue strategy for 2024",
      "text": "It was perhaps not the venue one might have expected for Donald Trump to offer his most famous assessment of the sturdiness of his support.He was standing beneath the enormous pipe organ at the front of the B.J. Haan Auditorium at Iowa’s Dordt College in January 2016. The organ isn’t only decorative; Dordt is a Christian school, and the auditorium is used for religious services.But on that day, Trump was addressing a different omnipotent deity.“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?” he said. “It’s, like, incredible.”Thou shalt not kill, but if thee do, worrieth not about thy polls.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpAt the time, it was taken as a melodramatic statement of enthusiasm, one that seemed accurate on its face but which was unlikely to be tested. Since Trump lost the 2020 election, however, the possibility that Trump supporters might be asked to evaluate their support for a candidate credibly accused of illegal behavior has become a reality.Trump was indicted in Manhattan in April and faces possible criminal charges related to his handling of documents with classification markings and for his efforts to retain power despite that loss. Washington Post-ABC News polling released this week shows that most Americans think Trump should face criminal charges in each of those cases, as well as for his role in fomenting the violence that unfolded at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.There is a catch, of course: While Democrats overwhelmingly think Trump should face charges, Republicans overwhelmingly don’t.In 2023, Trump’s comment about shooting someone on Fifth Avenue takes on a different sheen. Were it to happen, we now understand that the response from his base wouldn’t be “Trump shot someone, but I’m OK with that.” It would, instead, be “the fake-news media are lying about Trump shooting someone and leftist prosecutors are pressing charges to keep him from running in 2024.” It’s not simply that Trump’s supporters accept his improper behavior. It’s that many of them don’t view his behavior as improper, often because they dislike or disagree with those who are pointing out the impropriety.Even with that said, though, there is an element of indifference to Trump’s potential criminal culpability. The Post-ABC poll included hypothetical matchups between President Biden and Trump as well as between Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).Overall, Biden trails both Republicans — Trump by 7 points and DeSantis by 5 points. Among those who think Trump should face charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election results, Biden has an overwhelming lead over both Trump and DeSantis.But about 15 percent of those who say Trump should face charges also indicate that they would probably or definitely vote for Trump over Biden anyway.You can see the robustness of Trump’s baseline of support here. There’s not much difference between how he fares against Biden and how DeSantis fares against Biden among those who think Trump likely committed crimes. It’s, like, incredible: About 1 in 7 people who think that Trump should be criminally sanctioned for trying to subvert American democracy also say they’d probably vote for him to be president in a contest against Biden.That’s the Fifth-Avenue crowd, the Trump supporters for whom criminal conduct is no barrier to support. Again, that’s not our saying Trump committed a crime. It’s them saying he should be charged. But also be president instead of Biden.On Tuesday, a political action committee associated with former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney (R) released an ad insisting that Trump is too dangerous to be granted the presidency again.This is a continuation of Cheney’s work on the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot. Then, her stated outcome was to demonstrate Trump’s lack of fitness to again be commander in chief.It’s hard to imagine the ad will be particularly persuasive, though that might not be the point. There are certainly Americans who are unfamiliar with the breadth of Trump’s efforts and culpability for the riot; Trump’s media allies have seen to that. But many of those who are aware of Trump’s actions have already formed opinions of them and of him — generally, it’s safe to say, in opposition to his candidacy. Some portion of the public, though, thinks Trump incited the riot and doesn’t really care or see it as prohibitive in the way that Cheney would want.The aim of the anti-Trump ad, which will air in New Hampshire, may be to spur anti-Trump Republicans to cast ballots in the primary rather than convince anyone of what he did. But if the 2024 election is between Trump and Biden, the results may come down to fewer than 100,000 votes in a handful of states, as was the case in 2016 and 2020.If that happens, the difference may be that 8 percent of the public who thinks Trump should be charged for trying to overturn the election and who think that he is a better candidate for president than Joe Biden.",

      "title": "Analysis | Biden’s mental sharpness polling decline",
      "text": "The 2020 presidential election featured our oldest matchup ever. And in the end, the age issue was basically a wash. Pre-election polls showed Americans were evenly divided on whether Joe Biden and Donald Trump had the physical and mental health to serve, and election exit polls showed the same.An even older potential 2024 rematch is shaping up quite differently. This is now an issue that cuts significantly against President Biden, and it has been trending in that direction for a while.A new Washington Post-ABC poll this weekend spotlighted this better than anything to date. While 54 percent said Trump had the mental sharpness it takes to effectively serve as president, just 32 percent said the same of Biden. The split was even bigger on physical health, with 63 percent saying Trump passed their test and just 33 percent saying Biden did.Independents were significantly more likely to see Trump as being both mentally and physically fit, with only around 3 in 10 independents saying Biden was either of those things.And while fewer than half said Trump, 76, was too old to be president, about 7 in 10 said the same of Biden, 80.This is one poll, and it’s a poll that’s less friendly overall to Biden than others have been recently. But it’s hardly the only one to show this emerging split.That poll also reinforced something from the other polling: that this is likely to be one of Biden’s biggest liabilities.In that poll, these were Biden’s highest negative numbers among seven issues tested, including trustworthiness, likability and knowledge to serve as president. Similarly, the Pew poll tested six issues; this one was Biden’s second-worst, behind his ability to inspire.Importantly, this is now one of the rare personal traits — as opposed to policy positions — on which Trump has a clear advantage with the American people.The logical question from there is how much it matters. It will be tempting for Democrats to dismiss the import of this issue. Yes, even many left-leaning Americans express concern about this and don’t want Biden to run again, but they’ll likely close ranks behind him if he becomes the party’s nominee again. The 2020 election was in large part about the left rallying behind a candidate whom they didn’t necessarily love because the alternative was Trump. To the extent that same alternative looms in 2024, and it’s a 78-year-old man, perhaps that papers over this problem somewhat.But the pandemic-era 2020 campaign also allowed for a more carefully crafted one with fewer in-person interactions. Americans have now gotten to see a healthy dose of Biden in action as president — though he still rarely does news conferences — and there will be a greater premium on a public presence as the 2024 election nears.And for whatever reason, that soon-to-be-78-year-old alternative doesn’t suffer the same liability on these issues right now. Despite making tens of thousands of false and misleading claims, regularly sending off bizarre ALL CAPS social media missives and running a chaotic and sometimes seemingly aimless administration, he has a sizable advantage on the issue of mental sharpness.Democrats don’t want to have a conversation about all of that right now, for obvious reasons. They’d rather rally behind an incumbent president and foreclose a serious and potentially damaging primary challenge. But it’s not going to be something they will be able to play off forever.",

      "title": "In some GOP-dominated statehouses, Black and trans lawmakers punished",
      "text": "In more than a dozen deep-red states in recent months, Republican lawmakers passed bills to ban transgender health care and restrict access to abortions while ignoring calls for gun control measures.The fierce but futile opposition has often been led by a new generation of liberal lawmakers, some of them Black or transgender, who have represented their constituents by pushing the debate into places that have angered Republicans. GOP lawmakers have said Democrats are welcome to dissent but have to follow long-established rules of decorum, including acting civilly and not interrupting floor sessions.In some states, Republicans have voted to punish those lawmakers.In Montana, Republicans banished a transgender Democratic lawmaker from the house floor for championing a protest in the gallery over a bill to ban gender-affirming care for children. In Oklahoma, Republicans stripped a Black, nonbinary Democratic lawmaker of committee assignments when a protester took refuge in the lawmaker’s office for several hours after a scuffle with a state trooper. And in Tennessee, Republicans expelled two Black legislators for disrupting a floor session by participating in a protest for gun control.In each case, Republican leaders accused the Democrats of crossing lines and said they needed to be held to account for disrupting legislative activities or encouraging those who do.The unusually severe punishments — the kind of actions that have usually been reserved for lawmakers who broke laws — have alarmed democracy advocates and illustrate how polarized many statehouses have become, especially in legislatures where Republicans have secured supermajorities that render Democrats nearly powerless.Democrats in GOP-dominated legislatures can rarely rally enough votes to block legislation but can shape public opinion through floor speeches, committee debates and protests. While the resulting discipline some lawmakers have faced has limited their ability to speak in their own chambers, it has allowed them to spread their messages further and bring national attention to what is happening in their states.“The world turned its eyes towards Montana and saw how far the Republicans in this state would go to achieve their goals — that it wasn’t enough to pass the bills but that they were seeking to silence those who stood up to hold them accountable. And they were willing to throw away democracy in the process,” said state Rep. Zooey Zephyr (D), who was banned from the floor of the Montana House last month after saying that a bill outlawing gender-affirming care for children would increase the risk of suicide.Some Republicans have raised concerns that members of their party are emboldening their opposition with their disciplinary votes. That’s particularly true for the expulsion of two Tennessee lawmakers, said Oscar Brock, a Republican National Committee member from the state.“By expelling them and putting it on the news every night for really two weeks, it gave them a lot more power and a lot more prominence,” Brock said.The recent punishments echo moments from the civil rights era, including when the Georgia House refused to seat Black social activist Julian Bond in 1966 because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. The Supreme Court ultimately found Bond had been improperly kept out of office.“It’s strange to see history repeat itself. It was happening in waves then, and it is happening in waves now,” said Andrew Aydin, who co-wrote a graphic memoir with the late Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) that documents Bond’s experience.Tim Storey, the chief executive of the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan association of state legislators, cautioned that while the recent punishments have generated extensive media coverage, “there have been far more uncivil times” in U.S. statehouses.“People have literally been killed on the floors of legislatures before, physical fights have broken out,” Storey said, “so it wouldn’t be accurate to say this moment is unprecedented.”Not all of the lawmakers who have faced discipline recently have been Democrats. Last month, Republicans in the Arizona House joined with Democrats to expel a GOP lawmaker for “disorderly behavior.” The removal of Liz Harris, who has a history of spreading misinformation about elections and voting, stemmed from an explosive February hearing in which Harris’ witness accused a Mexican drug cartel of an unproven election-fraud scheme that involved bribing leaders from both major political parties, judges, election officials and others.A Republican-led ethics investigation into Harris’ activities surrounding the hearing found that she lied to her colleagues about her knowledge and role of her witness’ testimony. Harris and her supporters have cast her expulsion as undemocratic and are demanding her reinstatement. The 28 Democrats and 18 Republicans who supported her removal said they relied on the democratic process to oust her, which included a hearing that allowed her to defend herself.The punishment of state lawmakers has become so frequent and momentous this legislative session that Ballotpedia, a nonprofit online encyclopedia of American politics, decided in April to start compiling a historical account of state lawmaker expulsions.So far, Ballotpedia has tracked 70 cases in which elected officials were expelled from state legislative chambers between 1813 and 2023. They include 37 Democrats, 24 Republicans, and seven members of the Socialist Party. Since 2020, at least nine lawmakers have been kicked out of state legislatures. Among them were legislators accused of committing crimes, engaging in hostile behavior and, in one case, allowing armed far-right protesters into the Oregon Capitol.Much of the tension this spring has centered on legislation targeting transgender rights, as Republicans have introduced more than 400 bills, at least 35 of which have become law so far, according to a Washington Post analysis of data from the American Civil Liberties Union. That’s more than the number of such bills introduced over the previous four years combined.In the halls of the Oklahoma Capitol in February, there were cries of protest against legislation to ban gender-affirming care, including puberty-blocking treatments for gender dysphoric youth and hormone treatments for adults who transitioned years ago. State troopers allege transgender activist Devyn Mitchell threw water on a Republican lawmaker. When they moved in to arrest him, video shows, Mitchell pushed back against a trooper and yelled, “Respect me!”Mitchell’s partner, Ari Ross, briefly intervened, then stepped away and howled for help as the trooper handcuffed Mitchell, according to the video.Ross took refuge in the office of state Rep. Mauree Turner, a Black nonbinary Democrat who led opposition to the legislation. Republican lawmakers alleged Turner, who uses they/them pronouns, barred the troopers from questioning Ross, which the lawmaker denies.Ross said she went to Turner’s office for a few hours to calm down and that law enforcement officers eventually came to the office to meet with her. Arrest records make no mention of troopers being prevented from talking to Ross, and a spokeswoman for the troopers said she had no additional information beyond what’s in those documents. The district attorney has decided not to charge Ross, a spokeswoman for the district attorney said Monday.Turner, who was first elected in 2020, has not been charged with a crime, but Republican legislative leaders accused them of impeding a law enforcement investigation. A week after the incident in Turner’s office, Republicans voted to censure Turner — and removed the lawmaker from committee assignments — ordering Turner to apologize to the legislature to regain the positions. Turner has refused.“I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do,” said Turner. “These are people who are drunk on power and a need to control. A need to control me. A need to control others and their bodily autonomy.”Immediately following the vote, which fell along party lines, state House Speaker Charles McCall (R) issued a statement, saying Turner had “knowingly, and willfully, impeded a law enforcement investigation, harboring a fugitive and repeatedly lying to officers, and used their official office and position to thwart attempts by law enforcement to make contact with a suspect of the investigation.” McCall not return calls and emails seeking comment.State House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson (D) said Republicans have not provided evidence that Turner impeded the investigation, “not from the time of the incident to the time of the censure, not even to this day.”Munson argued the discipline Turner faced was far too harsh, noting the same punishment was given to state Rep. Dean Davis (R) after he was arrested in March for public intoxication and was captured by a police body camera saying he was not subject to arrest because he was a lawmaker. It was the second alcohol-related offense for Davis since he took office in 2018.  Records show Davis was censured after Munson publicly called on Republicans to hold their colleague to account for his actions.Davis, who did not respond to a request for comment, has denied wrongdoing but apologized for creating a distraction. He voted to censure Turner on March 7, but Turner did not vote to censure Davis on March 27.“We were all elected here, and the people who elected us will either make sure that we stay or make sure that we go,” Turner said during the debate over Davis’ censure.Turner said efforts to disenfranchise them continue. Two weeks ago, Turner said they were told they would not be allowed to vote because they had violated the House dress code by wearing a sweatshirt with the phrase “Protect American Families in the Mass Incarceration Crisis.” Turner noticed a Republican lawmaker a few seats away, they said, who was wearing a Blue Lives Matter necktie in support of law enforcement.“I walked up to leadership and said, ‘If you’re going to remove my vote, are you going to remove his? Is this something that you’re going to make sure is standard across the board?’” Turner recalled. “They dropped it because it wasn’t about violating a dress code. It was about silencing people of color and trans folks.”In Montana, Zephyr angered Republicans when she argued against legislation banning gender-affirming care for children and said: “I hope the next time there’s an invocation, when you bow your heads in prayer, you see the blood on your hands.”Republicans called the comment inappropriate and stopped recognizing her when she asked to speak on the floor. Days later, Zephyr’s supporters protested at the state Capitol and chanted “Let her speak” from the house gallery. Zephyr held up her microphone, which wasn’t turned on, in support. Republicans said she violated the rules of decorum and last month barred her from the house floor, saying she would have to cast votes remotely for the remaining two weeks of the legislative session.Montana House Majority Leader Sue Vinton (R ) said in a floor speech that Zephyr needed to be disciplined because she had “encouraged the continuation of the disruption of this body, placing legislators, staff and even our pages at risk of harm.”“Freedom in this body involves obedience to all the rules of this body, including the rules of decorum,” she said.Zephyr received national attention and thousands of supportive emails that she said show her 11,000 constituents were being heard even though Republicans had silenced her on the house floor.“I believe that the world has seen how far the extremists that have taken hold of the Republican Party will go — how far they will go, what they will cast aside,” she said. “And the world has also seen a glimpse of what our states, what our country can be when we, both as leaders and as a community, stand up together.”Zephyr and four of her constituents last week filed a lawsuit with the help of the ACLU arguing the banishment violated their rights to free speech and equal protection under the law. A judge declined to let her return to the house floor, ruling such a move “would require this court to interfere with legislative authority in a manner that exceeds this court’s authority.”Hours later, the legislative session ended, which terminated Zephyr’s censure. As soon as it did, she walked onto the house floor and hugged her colleagues, she said. Zephyr said she is exploring her options for continuing her lawsuit.In Nebraska, state Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh was threatened in March with censure after saying a trio of bills that sought to restrict transgender rights were meant to “legislate hate” and would lead to the “genocide” of transgender people.State Sen. Julie Slama, who sought the censure, took to Twitter to make her case against Cavanaugh: “We must draw a line in the sand for acceptable conduct in this Legislature, just like every other state legislature already has done.”Legislative leaders have so far declined to bring a vote.Matthew Brown, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Alice Crites contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez intends to run for Senate in 2024",
      "text": "Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez (D), a longtime lawmaker whose district includes Uvalde, Tex., intends to join the U.S. Senate race to challenge Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in 2024, according to three people familiar with Gutierrez’s plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a formal announcement has not yet been made.Gutierrez, 52, has served in the Texas state legislature since 2008, and represents the district where a gunman fatally shot 17 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School nearly a year ago. The mass shooting was the second-deadliest to take place at a school in the United States since 2012, when 20 children and six adult staff members were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.The shooting — and Gutierrez’s work with the families of the Uvalde victims afterward to try to enact gun legislation — galvanized the state lawmaker to seriously consider running for higher office, according to a person close to Gutierrez who has been familiar with his thinking over the last year.“It changes you,” the person said. “Seeing all of that failure, knowing all of that stuff, knowing what the state has purportedly done or not done … and then going into a session and talking to your colleagues and realizing that they still don’t [care]. They are just going to be cowards. And they will sit there and they will cry with the families, but then they won’t do anything.”Gutierrez would become the second Democrat to join the race, after Rep. Colin Allred (D-Tex.) announced his campaign last week. Texas state law prohibits sitting state lawmakers and other statewide officeholders from accepting campaign contributions during the regular legislative session. This year, the first day Texas lawmakers could accept political contributions would be June 19.When reached Tuesday, Gutierrez declined to confirm whether he was running.“The only thing that matters for the next three weeks is fighting for these families,” Gutierrez told The Washington Post. “That’s what I’m focused on right now.”He added that e would make “decisions on other things” after the Texas legislative session was done.Former Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Tex.), a longtime friend and mentor to Gutierrez, said Tuesday that he has “strongly encouraged” Gutierrez to enter the race.“I think he has shown real leadership in the aftermath of the Uvalde massacre, and I think his profile has risen in large part because of his proactive response to that event,” Vela said.Gutierrez has made justice and accountability for Uvalde’s victims the center of his legislative push, convening the families of the victims nearly every Tuesday during the 140-day legislative session to talk to reporters and lawmakers about gun control measures. Their early fight was for fair victim compensation but evolved to pulling the truth from government officials about what police did and did not do to stop the shooter. (He sued the Texas Department of Public Safety for Uvalde records.)“These families have been on an emotional roller coaster and been promised so much and it hasn’t happened,” Gutierrez said last month. “Whether it’s victim compensation or information from the government, they can’t trust it.”Critics have called Gutierrez a political opportunist. The Texas Senate president rebuked him for talking about guns. When Gutierrez interrupted Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) at a Uvalde news conference days after the massacre, his detractors bemoaned it as a stunt.But Gutierrez, whose voice still quivers when he talks about Uvalde, has said there is little else that matters than bringing the families of the victims justice. He calls the families his friends, has held parents’ hands as the investigations have continued, and knows where each child is buried.“They are all hurting, and they are doing their very best to heal,” Gutierrez told the Texas public safety commission in October. “But I think that the only thing they can really do and look forward to is a duller sense of pain.”Gutierrez has spoken openly about watching hours upon hours of body-cam footage of what happened in Uvalde — and though he signed a nondisclosure agreement to not divulge or distribute that information, he has said he cannot forget the screams or the damage the bullets did to the children’s bodies.“People need to really wake up. I mean, wake up to what’s happening here. It’s almost become some normal event for everybody. This is happening in your communities, and it can happen anywhere in the United States,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, responding to another mass shooting that had taken place at a Dallas area outlet mall over the weekend. “It’s just a sad state of affairs that we’re living in. This is not the Texas miracle that Greg Abbott likes to call it. We’re living in a Texas nightmare, and it’s a nightmare that they created. It’s a chaos that they created.”This week, Gutierrez, a San Antonio native, was at the state Senate every day alongside Uvalde families pushing for passage of several stalled bills that would, among other things, expand background checks and raise the age to purchase an AR-15 in Texas from 18 to 21.“Today is about the reality and the reality is that we are in a more dangerous state because Republicans have made it more dangerous,” Gutierrez said in a news conference Monday. “We are in a more dangerous state because of loose gun laws that allow everybody to walk down Congress [Avenue in Austin] with a gun and a cop can’t even ask you one question as to why.”The 2024 Senate map is brutal for Democrats, who must defend — in a presidential election year — eight seats in states that voted for Donald Trump or just narrowly backed Joe Biden in 2020. Texas, while still decidedly a long shot, represents the Democrats’ best opportunity to pick up a seat, given that Cruz has faced lagging approval ratings, according to University of Texas polling.Gilbert Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, acknowledged Tuesday that it would be an uphill battle for Democrats, in large part because of Republicans’ fundraising power for Texas races.“No matter how much money we were able to raise for either Sen. Gutierrez or Congressman Allred, [Republicans are] going to exceed it by double. So that’s the difficult side of that,” Hinojosa said. “The positive side for us is one has to do with the fact that the Cruz is hated in Texas. People in general just don’t like this guy because he’s a horrible human being — and you can quote me on that.”Hinojosa remained neutral when assessing a potential primary matchup between Allred and Gutierrez, noting that Texas has the largest African American population in the nation and the second largest Hispanic population in the nation.“The point is this is that either one of these two candidates have the potential to increase turnout in these key ethnic communities that are the base of the Democratic Party,” he said.Cruz, 52, was first elected to the Senate in 2012. He won reelection in 2018 by fewer than 3 percentage points, fending off a challenge from Democrat Beto O’Rourke. Cruz also ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, ultimately suspending his campaign after losing the Indiana primary and later endorsing his primary rival, Trump.While in office, Cruz has cheered the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, voted against a bill to protect same-sex and interracial marriages, voted against gun-control legislation, and argued for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.In his campaign launch video, Allred showed footage from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, in which a mob of Trump’s supporters overran the U.S. Capitol seeking to stop the certification of Biden’s electoral win.On that day, Allred said in the video, he heard glass breaking and texted his wife to say, “Whatever happens, I love you,” then took off his jacket and “got ready to take on anyone who came through that door.” He slammed Cruz for voting against the certification of election results that day and for hiding in a storage closet during the attack.“But that’s Ted for you: All hat, no cattle,” Allred said in the video.Liz Goodwin contributed to this report.",

      "title": "McCarthy sees no ‘movement’ on debt ceiling after meeting with Biden",
      "text": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he saw no “new movement” in an approximately hour-long meeting at the White House with President Biden and congressional leaders on Wednesday, as lawmakers run out of time to avoid a calamitous default.Emerging from the Oval Office, McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blamed the White House for rejecting the GOP’s proposal to slash spending in exchange for lifting the debt limit. Lawmakers have until sometime in June to lift the debt ceiling, which sets the maximum amount the U.S. can borrow, or court what experts say could be a global economic panic.“Everybody in this meeting reiterated the positions they were at,” McCarthy said. “I didn’t see any new movement.”McCarthy later expressed frustration that Biden did not appear to entertain any of his proposals for reducing spending. The White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt limit, arguing the federal government’s credit worthiness should not be weaponized by either party to demand concessions. Aides have instead said they’re open to a separate conversation on spending and future budgets.“I asked him numerous times, ‘Are there some places we could find savings?’ He wouldn’t give me any. So I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to find them,\" McCarthy said.McCarthy also said the lawmakers will aim to meet again on Friday and that staffers will continue to meet throughout this week.Biden hosted McCarthy and McConnell along with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) at the Oval Office, in a meeting that started at 4 p.m. Tuesday.“We’re going to get started, we’re going to solve all the world’s problems,” Biden joked to reporters before starting the meeting. The president and congressional leaders may also speak with reporters after the conclusion of the meeting, which is also being attended by chief of staff Jeff Zients, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young and top aides to the members of Congress.Ahead of the meeting, McCarthy told reporters that lawmakers may need an agreement in principle by next week to lift the debt ceiling before the government runs into financial trouble — a highly condensed timetable for talks that may only just now be beginning.“I think we need it by next week,” McCarthy said.On Wednesday, Biden will travel to New York to take his pressure campaign on the road, targeting moderate House Republicans who could prove to be critical in reaching a compromise on the debt ceiling. The president will hold a campaign-style event in Westchester County, N.Y., near the district of Rep. Michael Lawler (R-N.Y.), a moderate Republican who represents an area that supported Biden over President Donald Trump in 2020.The standoff is in some ways a familiar one in Washington, as a Republican-controlled House refuses to lift the debt ceiling unless a Democratic president agrees to sweeping spending cuts. Similar episodes played out in 2011 and 2013 under President Barack Obama, when Biden was vice president and last-minute deals were struck between the two sides.But the political landscape has changed significantly since then, leaving both sides jittery. McCarthy has a razor-thin majority of 222-213, including a faction of volatile hard-liners who could challenge his speakership if he makes compromises not to their liking. Some Democrats and Republicans worry that this time the stalemate could drag beyond the deadline, triggering catastrophic economic consequences.Washington, Wall Street brace for debt limit talksBiden says that raising the debt ceiling, necessary to fund items that have already been approved by Congress over the years, is a shared obligation that should not be subject to conditions by one side. Republicans say spending has surged out of control and that declining to raise the borrowing limit without spending cuts is eminently reasonable.1/4“House and Senate Republicans agree: Raising the debt limit without getting spending under control would be irresponsible,” McCarthy tweeted recently.The White House in recent days has emphasized that Biden is willing to discuss spending cuts as long as they are not tied to the debt ceiling increase, a message he is expected to repeat at Tuesday’s meeting.“President Biden will discuss the urgency of preventing default and stress that Congress must take action to avoid default without conditions,” Michael Kikukawa, a White House spokesman, said in a statement. “He will discuss how to initiate a separate process to address the budget and FY2024 appropriations.”The terms of a potential deal have remained elusive, although some congressional aides and outside observers say they are beginning to see the potential contours of an agreement.McCarthy’s bill to raise the debt limit, passed by the House last month, would cut federal spending by $4.8 trillion over 10 years. The White House has rejected that proposal, but Biden aides have recognized that they need to reach an agreement with House Republicans on government spending levels, regardless of the resolution to the debt limit.Some analysts argue that lawmakers should find a middle ground on these domestic spending numbers, clearing the way to both cut spending and raise the debt limit. Under that plan, GOP leaders could say the two moves are linked and the White House could insist that they are not.“There is a solution staring lawmakers in the face,” said Brian Riedl, a policy analyst at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank. “Just come up with something in the middle and call it a day.”Yet that may prove more difficult in practice than on paper. House Republicans have not said which federal programs they would cut, and it’s not clear they could reach a consensus on that. Beyond that, enormous gaps remain between the spending cuts the GOP is demanding and the levels Biden would accept.“What looks good on paper for the purposes of House Republicans’ budget politics does not look good when they have to explain what that means to programs that matter for the American people,” said Charlie Ellsworth, a former Schumer aide who is at Pioneer Public Affairs.Some on Capitol Hill have suggested that as a temporary measure, the debt limit could be raised through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, when the current federal budget expires. That way a new budget, including spending cuts, could be enacted along with a debt limit increase.But so far at least, neither the GOP nor the White House has shown interest in that idea.In its latest estimate, the Bipartisan Policy Center on Tuesday predicted the U.S. government could reach the “x-date” when it can’t pay all its bills without borrowing some time between June and August, cautioning that the range again reflects the “unpredictability of cash flows.”The next few weeks of May are critical, since a strong showing in tax receipts could buy more time for Washington, opening the door for the Treasury Department to take additional “extraordinary measures” next month that could push the deadline into July.Speaking on CNBC on Monday, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, who has warned that the government could default as early as June 1 if no action is taken, reiterated the potentially catastrophic impact of failing to lift the debt limit. Biden aides have explored, but are wary of acting on, several options for ignoring Congress and trying to resolve the debt ceiling unilaterally.Biden aides see risk in declaring debt limit unconstitutional“It will have tremendously adverse effects on financial markets and the economy. There is no good option other than raising the debt ceiling,” Yellen said.Financial markets have begun reacting to the standoff, if mildly so far. Yields on one-month U.S. Treasury bills have spiked as investors demand a higher return on government debt viewed as increasingly uncertain. Investors are also bidding up the price of U.S. credit default swaps, which insure against a federal default.Still, Wall Street has mostly ignored the growing standoff, as investors continue to expect lawmakers to come to a resolution before breaching the debt limit. Stocks remained relatively stable on Monday, and analysts are more likely to attribute price fluctuations in the bond market over the past few weeks to the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes than to concerns about the debt limit.“People are thinking overall that it’s too awful, too catastrophic, to try and even prepare for,” said Chris Rupkey, a financial analyst at FwdBonds. He added of investors, “They feel that just like all other times, we’ll get through this and both sides will eventually sign off.”The White House has slammed Republicans in recent days who supported McCarthy’s budget bill, arguing that the budget cuts would have devastating impacts on schools, health care coverage, Social Security and other benefits programs.“House Republicans that brand themselves as moderate lined up with the most extreme MAGA members on this vote, and we are making sure their constituents are aware of the true nature of their priorities,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt said in a statement. “It’s up to them whether they will continue to side with MAGA extremists or come together to ensure that the country avoids default.”Tony Romm contributed to this report.The latest: Today, President Biden will meet with congressional leaders in an urgent bid to avoid a government default. White House officials see enormous risks in trying to resolve the debt ceiling impasse without Congress.Understanding the debt ceiling fight: Biden and the House Republican leadership are on a collision course over the national debt limit. Here’s when the debt ceiling battle could end.What is at stake? If the debt limit is breached, Biden warned that it could send the U.S. economy into a free fall. The debt ceiling breach could wipe out 8 million jobs, a recent White House analysis found. Amid consumer anxiety over the uncertainty, financial experts warn against making fear-based decisions.",

      "title": "Jake Alu’s years-long journey leads to sudden major league call-up",
      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Jake Alu stood in the visitors’ clubhouse at Oracle Park on Monday afternoon. He wore a red shirt with a Washington Nationals logo on the upper left corner. He was surrounded by teammates and had a child-like grin on his face. He still couldn’t quite believe that he was really in the major leagues.Just a day earlier, Alu hit a home run for Class AAA Rochester. Then he was called into the manager’s office and told he would be making his major league debut. The Red Wings were in Scranton, Pa., so he went back to Rochester in Upstate New York to pack his bags. He flew from Rochester to Chicago to San Francisco and arrived by noon. He didn’t have much time to take it all in.“It’s one of the greatest feelings ever,” Alu said about being called up. “Honestly, it all hasn’t set in yet, if I’m being honest. But that’s something that you look forward to hearing your whole life. So that was a special moment. Alu, a 26-year-old utilityman, is here by necessity — center fielder Victor Robles was placed on the 10-day injured list Monday with back spasms. The Nationals are already without outfielder Corey Dickerson, who was placed on the IL with a left calf strain on April 2. Dickerson had the same injury last season and missed a month. He has been running, fielding groundballs and hitting during batting practice on this road trip — all positive signs that he may soon be able to head out on a minor league rehab assignment.How much Alu plays in the meantime remains to be seen. Jeter Downs, who was with the Nationals for almost a month, only played three innings between when he was called up April 11 and when he was sent down Wednesday. Alu’s situation is different from Downs’s, though, because Downs was on the depth chart behind CJ Abrams and Luis García, who need to play every day as the team’s future middle infield. Alu, on the other hand, will have a shot among a group of outfielders who aren’t considered as highly in the organization’s pecking order.Stone Garrett, Joey Meneses and Ildemaro Vargas are all options to play left field, according to Manager Dave Martinez, along with Alu, who provides the Nationals with another left-handed-hitting outfielder in Dickerson’s absence.“He can do a lot of different things, play some third, play some second,” Martinez said. “Last year, he played some left field. This year, because of his knee, priority was to just get him his at-bats. But he started, felt good enough to play the outfield. Played him out there a few times already this year. So, like I said, because of missing Robles, more of his playing time will be in the outfield. So we want to make sure we get him out and get him some work.”Alu dealt with a nagging left knee injury during spring training that slowed him down for a few weeks, and he was eventually sent to minor league camp. He started the year rehabbing in Wilmington, Del., before heading to Rochester. Alu called it a “freak thing” and couldn’t pinpoint when he started feeling pain, but he said it was all a part of his learning curve. Now he said he prepares in the gym differently so that the injury doesn’t flare up like it did before.Alu entered spring training seeming to have a shot — even if only a small one — to make the Nationals’ Opening Day roster as a bench player because of his positional versatility and his bat-to-ball skills. The Nationals protected him from the Rule 5 Draft by placing him on the 40-man roster. Last season, he hit 20 home runs across Class AA and Class AAA despite not being known as a power hitter. He finished the year with a .299 batting average.“I feel like I’ve been a grinder my whole life,” Alu said. “So [I’m] kind of sticking to that role: a tough out, a guy who can play all over the field, and someone who the skipper likes putting in the lineup every day.”Nationals’ Stone Garrett remembers his big league shotHis unlikely path to the majors as a 24th-round pick in the 2019 draft took a slight detour this year, but Alu said every player in the clubhouse can understand how every obstacle to the majors is a learning experience. That’s why he never doubted that he’d get there.“When you start thinking about all that stuff, then it makes things really tough and you kind of sink from there. I saw that from other people, and guys who have experienced that, they kind of teach you those things. So you’ve kind of got to grab on to everything and experience it and talk to older guys and just keep pushing through.”On Monday night, he stood in the clubhouse joking with Lane Thomas about dealing with the cold in Rochester. He took batting practice on the field before the game. Then he watched from the dugout as his former roommate Jake Irvin make his second career start against the Giants. He stood in the handshake line as his parents and girlfriend stood in the stands.Who knows when or whether the moment finally hit Alu on Monday, but it was a long time coming.",

      "text": "The leader of the Wagner mercenary group issued a blistering statement denouncing Russia’s defense leaders for “treason” and “destruction” on Tuesday — a particularly vociferous denunciation that came as Russian President Vladimir Putin praised the nation’s military strength amid a pared-down Victory Day celebration.The holiday, among Russia’s most important, celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi German in the Second World War — a fight Putin has often invoked to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the Wagner head, claimed that his troops had “no ammunition” and that Russian troops were fleeing their positions in Ukraine. Blaming “those who give them orders and who set the tasks,” he said that “the fish rots from the head.” He declared that it was no time to celebrate: “Victory Day is the victory of our grandfathers. We don’t deserve this victory one millimeter.”The Biden administration on Tuesday announced a $1.2 billion aid package aimed at bolstering Ukraine’s air defenses and sustaining its ammunition supply.Here’s the latest on the war and its impact across the globe.What to know about Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: Rocket and mortar attacks near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine have sparked international concern, prompting world leaders and even Pope Francis to plead for calm. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelensky said last summer.Nearly a year later, the situation at the facility — which is controlled by Russia but connected to Ukraine’s power grid — remains dire, with Russian authorities preparing to evacuate about 3,100 staff members from areas in and around the facility this week.

      "title": "Commanders doubled down on DBs early in the draft. Will it pay off?",
      "text": "Every Thursday during the season, Washington Commanders assistant defensive backs coach Richard Rodgers gives a presentation about forcing turnovers. In practice sessions on those days, offensive linemen spend part of their individual period diving for loose footballs and defensive backs work on picking off passes.Last year, the Commanders went a step further with a bit of bribery.Those who succeeded in creating takeaways in games the previous week received a black T-shirt with the words GET THE DAMN BALL OUT in gold lettering. Consider it a less flashy version of the University of Miami’s famed turnover chain.“Listen, if the supply of shirts runs out, you might get a fresh one,” defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio jokingly assured last year.Commanders 2023 NFL draft class: What each player brings to the rosterFor the better part of the last three years, since Ron Rivera took over as head coach and tabbed Del Rio to lead the defense, the Commanders have preached creating takeaways and limiting explosive plays. Their defense transformed into a top-five unit in total yards and passing yards allowed last season, but they recorded only nine interceptions and forced turnovers on only 7.6 percent of opponents’ drives, tied for the third-lowest rate in the NFL. They also allowed a league-high 16 completions of at least 40 yards.“You can make a mistake in the front and it might pop through, but it should get capped before it becomes an explosive play,” Del Rio said in November. Preventing such plays, Del Rio said, relies on “the secondary doing a good job of leveraging, tackling and being in the right spots.”So it should be no surprise that Washington used not only its first-round pick but also its second-round selection this spring on defensive backs, Emmanuel Forbes and Quan Martin, players whose college résumés stand out for their production and ball skills.Forbes, a 166-pound cornerback taken 16th overall out of Mississippi State, is the Football Bowl Subdivision’s career leader in pick-sixes. Martin, the 47th pick out of Illinois, had the highest hand-on-ball rate (2.2 percent) and averaged the most pass-breakups per game (1.2) among draft-eligible safeties, according to Sports Info Solutions. He also played the majority of his snaps in the slot, and will likely become the Commanders’ next “Buffalo” nickel in packages with three safeties.But the early rounds of the Commanders’ draft were notable as much for the players selected as for the positions the team didn’t address — even though Rivera’s messaging throughout the offseason pointed to this outcome. They selected based on need and value, but also proved they’re willing to gamble.Rivera said in January the Commanders planned to reconfigure their interior offensive line — and they did. They signed center Nick Gates, drafted Ricky Stromberg in the third round, released veteran Chase Roullier and indicated left guard will be a competition between Saahdiq Charles and Chris Paul. The Commanders also added Andrew Wylie, a starter in Kansas City who played guard and tackle during his tenure, and signed veteran tackle Trent Scott.Commanders’ draft class fills several needs, features plenty of valueThe Commanders didn’t draft an offensive tackle in the first couple of rounds, when the odds of finding a potential starter are generally higher. They waited until the fourth round to draft Braeden Daniels, an athletic guard/tackle out of Utah who adds depth at both spots.Rivera also said in January that quarterback Sam Howell will get every chance to start, with veteran Jacoby Brissett as his likely backup. Washington didn’t draft another quarterback — at all — even though Hendon Hooker and Will Levis were available in the first and second rounds (Levis was later drafted by the Titans in the second round and Hooker was selected by the Lions in the third).So the near future of the team hinges not on their newest rookies, but mostly on 22-year-old Howell, a one-game starter learning a new system with a new play-caller amid an ownership change.No pressure.“The one thing that we still have confidence in and [are] very comfortable with is what we have at quarterback,” Rivera said during the draft. “We think Sam and Jacoby [Brissett] and Jake [Fromm] for that matter, give us a good room right now.”Howell became the Commanders’ eighth starting quarterback since 2020 when he got his first start against the Cowboys in Week 18 last season. His numbers in the win over the Cowboys weren’t gaudy — 169 passing yards and two total touchdowns — and they included an interception in the end zone. But he managed the game, got the ball out quickly (Rivera often cites Howell’s quick passes to Jahan Dotson as evidence) and used his legs to extend plays.Washington has retooled its roster over the years to create a deep group of playmakers. It can only hope the altered offensive line is spared the many injuries it endured the last few seasons. And a more productive defense, with Forbes and Martin, could help a young quarterback and transitioning offense.Time will tell if the gamble paid off. In the meantime, perhaps Del Rio should order a few more turnover T-shirts.",

      "title": "Putin says ‘real war’ being waged against Russia in muted Victory Day parade",
      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that a “real war” is being waged against Russia amid muted Victory Day celebrations on Tuesday, with many mass events canceled over security concerns after last week’s alleged drone attack on the Kremlin and a looming Ukrainian counteroffensive.The event marking the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany 78 years ago was also marred by an outburst from Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a key participant in the war on Ukraine and a vocal critic of the military leaders managing it. The chief of the Wagner mercenary group said in a video message that today’s Russians don’t deserve to celebrate the World War II victory of their grandfathers.In his seven-minute speech, Putin said: “A real war has once again been waged against our homeland. Today, civilization is at a critical juncture.”“We want to see a future of peace, freedom and stability,” added the leader, who more than a year ago ordered what he calls “the special military operation” in Ukraine that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Putin quickly pivoted to blaming the war on “Western elites.”Wagner boss threatens to pull out of Bakhmut, slams Russian military“We believe that any ideology of superiority is inherently disgusting, criminal and deadly,” he said. “However, Western globalists and elites still talk about their exclusivity; pit people and split society; provoke bloody conflicts and upheavals; sow hatred, Russophobia, aggressive nationalism; and destroy traditional family values that make a person a person.”Putin then reiterated his claim that Ukraine has become “hostage to a coup d’etat and the criminal regime formed by its Western masters” and “a bargaining chip in the implementation of their cruel, selfish plans.”Under Putin, the May 9 parades and marches designed to commemorate the World War II victory in Europe and honor its remaining veterans have morphed into a showcase of Russian military might, with giant Iskander ballistic missiles and modern Armata tanks rolling through the streets of Moscow.But Tuesday’s display was much more modest compared with those of previous years. Military experts noted that the 45-minute parade featured about 50 vehicles, a drastic decrease from the 2021 event that showcased 131 pieces, and there was only one tank — a World War II-era T-34. The traditional flyover of military aircraft was canceled.🧵Russian May 9th Parade 2023 vehicle composition thread. Now we finally get to compare this year's parade to the previous years'. This year I have not seen an official lineup released for the first time. Last year 131 vehicles took part, down from over 200 the previous years pic.twitter.com/qKL8JQrsLgAnd while Putin preached unity and support for the war among Russian people, the discord in his ranks grew stronger. The moment the parade ended, Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary boss, released a half-hour video in which he lashed out against the Russian Defense Ministry. He accused one regular unit of abandoning positions near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and the top brass of not supplying his soldiers with enough ammunition.“Victory Day marks the victory of our grandfathers; we did not deserve a single bit of this victory. We’re all set on TV, [but] the Ukrainian offensive will be on the ground,” Prigozhin barked into the camera.Criticism of the war is essentially outlawed in Russia, with hundreds of activists detained and thousands in exile. But Prigozhin, who rose in prominence last year by sending his private army to aid Putin’s war effort, has been permitted to criticize the regular army with seeming impunity.“Happy Victory Day to all of our grandfathers, and what we are celebrating is a big question. You just need to remember about them and don’t [mess] around on Red Square,” he added, using a profanity.Prigozhin has been engaged in a months-long bitter public campaign against Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, whom he accused of incompetence and of “stealing” Wagner’s victories in Ukraine. The rivalry reached a fever pitch last week, when Prigozhin said he would pull his fighters from Bakhmut, so far the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. He claimed that his units are receiving just a fraction of necessary munitions and are suffering major losses as a result.Russian forces have been locked in a grinding battle there since last summer and have not ousted Ukrainian forces, leaving Putin with no military gains to boast of in his speech.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also noted the lack of Russian progress in Bakhmut on Tuesday. “Russia’s leadership wasn’t able to sell [a victory] in Bakhmut, because they couldn’t seize it … before May 9.”The parade was the first public event that Putin has attended since Moscow’s stunning accusation last week that Ukraine sent two drones flying toward the Kremlin fortress in what Russian officials labeled an “assassination attempt” on their leader — a claim broadly rejected by political and military experts. Kyiv denied any responsibility.Victory Day commemorates the defeat of Nazi Germany in what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War that left more than 20 million Russians dead. The anniversary normally features parades across the country.This year, for the first time, the Victory Parade was broadcast on large-format outdoor screens around the city and on the subway.Security was tight in the Russian capital, with special forces police patrolling the center and stopping and inspecting commercial vans, while police vehicles waited on standby in side streets. Red flags banded with the orange and black Saint George ribbon lined Moscow’s streets, and screens on street corners depicted scenes of World War II, underscoring the Kremlin’s attempt to equate the Soviet sacrifice in that past war with its present fight to crush Ukrainian resistance.Putin was accompanied by some of his few remaining allies, including the leaders of Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia and Belarus. Almost all of them labeled their visits as “working trips,” during which they planned to participate in Victory Day ceremonies.Regional officials have been anxious about holding huge public events amid the Ukraine war — which is increasingly felt by Russians at home after a series of unexplained fires and explosions — even before the drones blew up over what is supposed to be one of the most protected buildings in the country.At least 20 cities across Russia canceled Victory Day parades, with regional officials saying they didn’t want to “provoke the enemy with large amounts of equipment and military personnel” gathered in one place or out of concern that returning Russian soldiers may perceive the sound of fireworks “in a completely different way.”The Immortal Regiment, an annual procession that draws millions of Russians carrying photographs of relatives who fought in World War II to march across most major cities, was canceled. Putin had traditionally led the march in Moscow himself.But the drone incident, which some analysts speculated was a false-flag attack while others said it might have been carried out by Ukrainian partisans or anti-Kremlin diversion groups working from inside the country, has been weaponized by the Russian authorities to galvanize public support for the war and justify the drastically scaled-back events.Since the supposed attacks, more than half of Russia’s regions have banned the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, while Moscow residents complain about increased GPS jamming in the city center disrupting taxi services. The capital’s street police officers have been reportedly handed binoculars with the order to watch out for more drones in the sky.Spike in Russian combat deaths fuels fears of worse carnage to comeSeven attending foreign leaders is high for the Kremlin’s main Victory Day parade in recent years. Last year, Putin watched the event alone. Seven leaders from former Soviet countries attended in 2020, when the ceremony was pushed from May 9 to June 22 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 70th Victory Day anniversary in 2015 included the highest number of foreign guests, with dozens of representatives arriving from around the world.Some commentators suggested the expanded guest list may be a tactic to make any diversion attempt too risky.“This dramatically reduces the likelihood of a terrorist attack on the parade on Red Square by Ukraine,” Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political scientist and former lawmaker, wrote in his Telegram blog.In recent years, Putin has been increasingly focused on ensuring that Russians are presented with a simplified and glorified version of their country’s history, one that delves into its many conquests, including the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. The victorious narrative and the legacy it carries into the future is peddled by the state bureaucratic machine across all groups of Russian society, starting as early as kindergarten.Since last year, schools and kindergartens introduced thematic classes meant to “explain” to young Russians the importance of what the Kremlin calls “the special military operation” in Ukraine.This Victory Day, the presentation of military themes to the country’s youths has reached a new level, according to local media reports, with kindergartners and other schoolchildren writing letters to soldiers and making crafts “to raise morale” or teachers staging performances to “instill a sense of pride in the heroism of our people and a steady interest in the army” into their students.David L. Stern in Kyiv contributed to this report.Portraits of Ukraine: Every Ukrainian’s life has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion one year ago — in ways both big and small. They have learned to survive and support each other under extreme circumstances, in bomb shelters and hospitals, destroyed apartment complexes and ruined marketplaces. Scroll through portraits of Ukrainians reflecting on a year of loss, resilience and fear.Battle of attrition: Over the past year, the war has morphed from a multi-front invasion that included Kyiv in the north to a conflict of attrition largely concentrated along an expanse of territory in the east and south. Follow the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces and take a look at where the fighting has been concentrated.A year of living apart: Russia’s invasion, coupled with Ukraine’s martial law preventing fighting-age men from leaving the country, has forced agonizing decisions for millions of Ukrainian families about how to balance safety, duty and love, with once-intertwined lives having become unrecognizable. Here’s what a train station full of goodbyes looked like last year.Deepening global divides: President Biden has trumpeted the reinvigorated Western alliance forged during the war as a “global coalition,” but a closer look suggests the world is far from united on issues raised by the Ukraine war. Evidence abounds that the effort to isolate Putin has failed and that sanctions haven’t stopped Russia, thanks to its oil and gas exports.",

      "title": "Perspective | With slur, Bob Huggins showed what he thinks. No apology can change that.",
      "text": "The thing about Bob Huggins using — and these are his words now — a “completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase that there is simply no excuse for” is that it had to come from somewhere. That somewhere is in the forefront of Huggins’s mind. He wanted to make fun of students from an old rival, Jesuit school Xavier University, and the way to crack a joke that leaped into his 69-year-old brain was to blanket them with an anti-gay slur. Hysterical.What Huggins’s employer, West Virginia University, does with its men’s basketball coach after Huggins revealed himself as a homophobe on a Cincinnati radio show Monday is almost secondary. He is exposed for who he is, because in what the hosts were framing as a casual discussion about transfers, Huggins grabbed hold of the conversation and took it directly in an indefensible direction. The audio has a strong it’s-just-us-guys-here vibe to it, and we know the humor just us guys enjoy when the doors are closed, right?The particulars: With Huggins as his guest by phone, longtime Cincinnati radio host Bill Cunningham asked the coach if his incoming class of transfers included any former Xavier players. Huggins coached at Cincinnati for 16 seasons and knows intimately the rivalry known as the Crosstown Shootout.“Any school that can throw rubber penises on the floor and then say they didn’t do it, my God, they can get away with anything,” Huggins said, a reference to — well, that’s not entirely clear. Cunningham, who was joined in studio by former Huggins assistant coach Steve Moeller, guffawed. Cunningham then tossed in what he clearly believed was a joke: “I think it was ‘transgender night,’ wasn’t it?”The door was open. Huggins eagerly stepped through it.“What it was all those f--s, those Catholic f--s, I think,” he said. There was an awkward pause before Huggins said, “They were envious they didn’t have one.”Laughter ensued.“Steve, your comments about Bob Huggins,” Cunningham said. “Is he the best?”“He’s the best,” Moeller responded.This all would have been offensive in 1973, let alone 2023. It would be galling had it been uttered by an adjunct professor without tenure, let alone the highest-paid public employee in the state, someone granted more than $4.25 million in 2022. Late Monday afternoon, Huggins was posting an apology through the Mountaineers’ Twitter account. The apology, in its entirety:“Earlier today on a Cincinnati radio program, I was asked about the rivalry between my former employer, the University of Cincinnati, and its crosstown rival, Xavier University,” the statement said. “During the conversation, I used a completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase that there is simply no excuse for — and I won’t try to make one here. I deeply apologize to the individuals I have offended, as well as the Xavier University community, the University of Cincinnati and West Virginia University. As I have shared with my players over my 40 years of coaching, there are consequences for our words and actions, and I will fully accept any coming my way. I am ashamed and embarrassed and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I must do better, and I will. In a world littered with If-I-offended-anybody-I’m-sorry non-apology apologies, this is a step up. But it doesn’t get to what matters here. It’s not that Huggins felt comfortable saying what he said in a public forum. It’s that he had the thoughts in the first place.Imagine being a West Virginia player, a West Virginia staff member, a West Virginia student assistant who identifies as LGBTQ. How you felt about Huggins on Sunday and what you know about him Tuesday have to be completely different, and the bell can’t be unrung. There is raw honesty in that audio that is alarming, an attempt to turn sexual identity into humor. How could a gay person work for or with Huggins not just because of what he said but because of what those words reveal about how he thinks? The mouth doesn’t form the words unless they’re already living in the brain, which means somewhere in Huggins’s inner workings he thinks it’s okay to belittle someone because they’re gay.Maybe this will register as a blip for a man who has been a head coach for 38 Division I seasons and won 863 games. Maybe it will cost him his job. In a statement Monday, WVU said it “takes such actions very seriously. The situation is under review and will be addressed by the university and its athletic department.”I have covered Bob Huggins’s games. I do not know Bob Huggins. But I do know him better than I did over the weekend. And the disturbing part about that new familiarity isn’t so much that the words were broadcast on the air and later distributed on the internet. The disturbing part is that a man entrusted with molding young minds kept that kind of thinking in his own.",

      "title": "A child thought he saw trash in a creek. It was a mammoth’s tooth.",
      "text": "Jeremiah Longbrake was jumping on a trampoline outside of his grandmother’s house after school last month when he decided to hop down and explore the stream that runs through her property in Winston, Ore.As Jeremiah, 9, approached the stream, he saw what he thought was a dirty plastic container.He used a stick to get the object out of the creek bed “because I didn’t want to leave pollution in the water,” he said. But when he picked up the dark brown lump, he realized that it appeared to be layered and wasn’t made of plastic.“It felt like it was a medium-sized rock,” Jeremiah said.He ran inside to show his grandmother and his mother what he’d found.“He came running up the steps and shouted, ‘Hey, Mom, look at this!’” said his mother, Megan Johnson, noting that the object was about the size of her son’s two fists.“I thought it looked like petrified wood,” she said. “But when I checked it out more closely, I could see it had an odd shape, and that it was plated.”Johnson, 31, decided to snap some photos and post them on her Facebook page in the hope that someone might be able to identify what Jeremiah had fished out of the stream that afternoon on April 11.“People started commenting, ‘Hey, that looks like a tooth,’” she said, adding that she was confused because it did not look like any tooth she’d seen before. “So I started calling around to find an expert who could tell us for sure whether it was a tooth or just an odd-shaped rock.”Hundreds of pounds of pasta mysteriously appeared in the N.J. woods. Cue the puns.Three days and several phone calls and emails later, her family had an answer: It was a large fragment from the tooth of a mammoth, the gigantic tusked mammal that roamed Earth more than 10,000 years ago.Patrick O’Grady, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History, was familiar with what mammoth teeth looked like and confirmed the finding. Upon seeing the photos, he said he knew instantly what it was. Identifying most parts of ancient animal fossils is difficult, but not mammoth teeth, he said. They’re quite distinct.“We were all pretty shocked and excited,” Johnson said. “We’ve enjoyed rockhounding in our family for years, but nobody has ever found anything like this.”“It’s definitely much cooler than the stuff I found as a kid,” she added.O’Grady was also enthusiastic about Jeremiah’s backyard discovery. Johnson had emailed him photos of the grooved tooth after another archaeologist in Oregon referred her to his office.When cafe owner sees panhandlers, he does not oust them, he feeds them“Finding anything like this that is over 10,000 years old is really unusual, especially in western Oregon where the landscape is covered with heavy layers of soil and lots of vegetation,” O’Grady said.“And for [Jeremiah] to pluck this from a stream bed is even more incredible,” he added. “If it had tumbled downstream in the water, the energy impact would have torn the layers of enamel to pieces after bumping into other rocks.”O’Grady said that Jeremiah was at the right place at the right time to retrieve the fossilized tooth “before it could be lost to the ages.”“He’s living the dream of every adult who wanted to find something like that when they were his age,” he said. “It’s really uncommon.”Mammoths roamed the planet from about 300,000 years ago until they became extinct about 10,000 years ago, O’Grady noted.“They could stand nine feet at the shoulder, and they got up into the 12,000-pound range,” he said. “They were also pretty widespread around this part of the country.”A 2015 study by researchers at the University of Adelaide in Australia concluded that abrupt climate change may have caused the enormous mammals — closely related to elephants — to become extinct.Some scientists now hope to create something similar to a woolly mammoth, one species of mammoth, through cloning, using the same process that was used in 1997 to create Dolly the sheep. Jeremiah acknowledged that it would be cool to see a live mammoth, but he said he’s happy with a tooth, even though his friends at school initially thought it was fake when he showed it to them.“Now they know it’s true,” he said.Jeremiah’s grandmother estimates that the tooth was found about 100 feet from her house.“We’ve always rock-hunted — I used to take his mom rock and fossil hunting when she was young and we’d find arrowheads and fossils of leaves,” said Rhonda Johnson, 64. “But for Jeremiah to find something like this was way beyond what any of us could figure out.”“I’m thankful to those who got involved and identified this as a mammoth tooth,” she added, noting that some people now wonder whether the rest of the mammoth might be buried somewhere on her property.“They ask if we’ve found anything else, but so far, no,” Rhonda Johnson said. “You never know, though. There could be. I’m just happy Jeremiah found [the tooth]. It’s been a lot of fun for him.”Tiny dolls appeared in mailbox with a note: ‘We’ve decided to live here’O’Grady said he’d love to eventually give the tooth a close examination and perhaps send a dime-sized sample to an archaeology lab for radiocarbon dating so a more precise time frame can be determined.That would be fine with Jeremiah at some point. His mom said he hasn’t made a decision yet whether to donate the tooth to a museum.“He wants to hang on to it for now, because it’s his incredible find,” she said. “I hope his experience will encourage other curious kiddos to get outside and look around. There is still a lot of stuff out there, yet to be discovered.”",

      "title": "Analysis | The other toll of constant mass shootings",
      "text": "The most conservative way to describe gun violence in the United States over the last two weeks is to say that 27 people have been shot to death in “mass killing” events.This excludes a lot of other deaths from guns, some of which we’ll get to in a moment but others for which the toll is measured even more narrowly: people taking their own lives or any of the tens of thousands of other people otherwise killed by firearms each year in the United States.It also excludes scores of people shot but not killed in mass killing events and in general.It also excludes those who are the focus of this article: the hundreds of people who were present as gunmen opened fire in crowded public places. That toll is rarely considered, much less tallied, and while the effects of witnessing a shooting are not physically damaging, they nonetheless incur an avoidable cost.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThe way we talk about gun violence often centers either on annual totals — blurring the personal effects in a “one death is a tragedy, but” sense — or on mass killing events. So let’s start there. The 27 deaths indicated above have occurred in five events, according to the Mass Killing Database maintained by Northeastern University, USA Today and the Associated Press.In four of those five events, the death toll was the entirety of the damage. In the mass shooting at a mall outside Dallas this weekend, though, there were also seven people injured by the gunman.As many Americans are by now aware, mass killing events are distinct from mass shooting ones, a bit of America-specific vernacular that differentiates between the number of people killed in a single incident of gun violence (generally four) and the number of people struck by bullets (also generally four, including those wounded). The latter necessarily includes the former but is more expansive.Data from the Gun Violence Archive, which collects news reports of events in which at least four people are shot, indicates that there have been 36 such events in the past two weeks. Fifty-seven people have been killed — 30 of them in events where fewer than four people were shot to death.Far more people have been injured in those events: 128, according to the Gun Violence Archive data. In total, 185 people have been killed or injured in these mass shooting events.Again, this is in the last two weeks. The Mass Killing Database data indicate that 115 people have been killed so far this year in mass killing events. The Gun Violence Archive data indicate that 282 people have been killed in mass shooting events in 2023 and 1,100 people killed or injured.Then there’s that other toll. Pictures and video from the mass shooting in Allen, Tex., showed hundreds of people leaving the mall after the shooting ended. There were multiple news stories of people hiding in the backs of stores or crouching behind counters as the violence was underway. It’s probably impossible to know how many people were there, heard the gunfire and had to evacuate.In other such incidents, it’s easier to come up with an estimate. News reports after a shooting in Ocean Springs, Miss., indicate that there were about 200 people at the Scratch Kitchen when a gunman opened fire, wounding six people and killing one. In other events — unfolding at block parties, house parties, after-prom get-togethers — news reports offer estimates of how many people might have been affected.Videos from other mass shootings give a sense of scale.In Las Vegas, several dozen people scrambled to escape after gunfire erupted.In Texas, people rushed to get into cars to escape.🔴VOLUME UP!  This is the moment four men were shot in Downtown Bryan this morning.  ▶️I've just updated the story with new information here--> https://t.co/LxGz1gI3if📸: Jazmine Chavez pic.twitter.com/2cP7eeCGAgIt’s probably impossible to know precisely how many people were present at similar events, but a review of news articles collected by the Gun Violence Archive indicates that, including the mall in Allen, a conservative estimate would suggest that more than 1,000 people were at mass shooting events even if they escaped without physical injury.Local news reports about mass shooting incidents elevate this broader community concern more acutely.“We know that our students who were at the party may be traumatized and in need of our support following this act of violence,” the principal of a Kentucky school wrote in a letter to families after a mass shooting unfolded at an after-prom party.Nor do the effects stop with those present at the events. A mass shooting in a California home became the talk of the community.“I’ve talked to everyone. In the grocery stores they’re talking about it, everyone at the Family Dollar, and even when I went to the gas station,” one woman told a local news outlet.Those effects, too, are hard to tally.There’s another commonality in the local news reports about mass shooting events: a sense of outrage and need for change. In article after article, reporters and residents articulate their frustration at gun violence seeming to be inevitable.Those news reports are quickly pushed down the page on local news  sites covering mass shooting events in: Adelanto, Calif.; Columbia, Mo.; Frostburg, Md.; St. Louis; Newark; Thornton, Calif.; Redwood City, Calif.; Chico, Calif.; Columbus, Ohio; Allen, Tex.; Robinsonville, Miss.; Natchez, Miss.; Bastrop, La.; Vicksburg, Miss.; Ocean Springs, Miss.; Chicago; Atlanta; Lake Wales, Fla.; Bossier City, La.; Lafayette, La.; Paducah, Ky.; Henryetta, Okla.; Oklahoma City; Las Vegas; Athens, Ga.; Bryan, Tex.; Mojave, Calif.; Bay St. Louis, Miss.; Lawrence, Mass.; Birmingham, Ala.; Columbia, S.C.; Auburn, Wash.; Philadelphia; and Cleveland, Tex.In the last two weeks.",

      "title": "3 militant leaders, 12 others reported killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza",
      "text": "JERUSALEM — Israel launched surprise airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing three leaders of the Islamic Jihad militant organization and 10 others, according to Palestinian health officials. As Palestinian armed groups vowed to retaliate, the region braced for an escalation of violence.Late Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces carried out an additional strike in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, targeting a squad of Islamic Jihad militants who the IDF said were driving antitank guided missiles to a launchpad. Two people in the car were killed and two others were injured in the strike, Palestinian media reported.“We’re at the height of an operation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement soon afterward.Israel said the morning strikes, carried out a week after it reached a cease-fire with Palestinian armed factions, targeted Khalil Bahtini, Jehad Ghanam and Tareq Izzeldeen — senior Islamic Jihad members who the IDF said were responsible for recent rocket fire and attacks against Israelis.At a security conference earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu said archenemy Iran was attempting a “multifront campaign” against Israel, according to Israeli media. Islamic Jihad is backed by Iran. Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza and is the dominant armed faction in the strip, also has received backing from Iran.Four women and four children were among those killed in the morning strikes, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. It said Israel was blocking the entry of diagnostic medical equipment, hindering Gazan hospitals’ ability to treat the at least 20 people injured in the strikes.Among the children killed, according to Palestinian media reports, were Bahtini’s 5-year-old daughter and two of Izzeldeen’s young children, whose ages were not given.Israeli military officials said they were aware of reports of civilian deaths and would investigate.Palestinian militants warned of repercussions, raising the possibility of a drawn-out conflict. Ismail Haniyeh, a senior leader of Hamas, said Israel would “pay the price.”“Assassinating leaders with a treacherous operation will not bring security to the occupier, but rather more resistance,” Haniyeh said in a statement.Islamic Jihad said in a statement that “the Palestinian response to this heinous aggressive massacre will not be delayed.” It vowed that “the al-Quds Bridgades and the resistance will never be complacent in the face of this pure blood.” The al-Quds Brigades is the military wing of the Islamic Jihad.Israeli military leaders said they were ready to call up reserve units, raising the specter of a prolonged escalation. Schools and universities across Israel were shuttered for the day, and roads near the Gaza border were closed.Islamic Jihad members have retaliated with rocket strikes after past Israeli attacks on their leaders, and the IDF Home Front Command told Israelis living near the Gaza border to remain close to shelters until Wednesday.Some Israeli families began evacuating from communities close to the Palestinian enclave, according to media reports, and some hospitals moved patients into fortified areas. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told local leaders to be “prepared for every scenario.”Bahtini served as commander of the northern branch of the al-Quds Brigades, replacing a leader who was assassinated by Israel in August. Ghanam, who had survived five assassination attempts, trained Islamic Jihad militants in Lebanon and Sudan.Israel-Gaza hostilities test Netanyahu’s hard-right governmentIzzeldeen, who was released in a 2011 prisoner exchange in which more than 1,000 Palestinian inmates were traded for an Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas, was from Arraba, a village near the West Bank city of Jenin. The village was the hometown of a high-profile Islamic Jihad leader, Khader Adnan, whose death last week after an 87-day hunger strike in Israeli custody prompted an exchange of fire between Israel and Gaza.Israel and Gaza had maintained a fragile truce since last week’s exchange of fire after Adnan’s death, which Palestinian officials called a “deliberate assassination.”Netanyahu has been criticized by other members of his far-right government for what they see as an overly tentative response to the rocket fire and other recent terrorist attacks.“It’s about time!” National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir tweeted Tuesday after the morning airstrikes. His Jewish Power party had been boycotting parliamentary votes in recent days to protest the cease-fire.Israeli officials told their Egyptian counterparts that their attacks were aimed at Islamic Jihad leaders and that they were not seeking a wider conflict, Israeli media reported. Hamas will determine the scope of any further escalation, Israel said.“The big question is Hamas and what they decide to do,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an IDF spokesman.The United Nations’ chief representative in the region said he was “deeply alarmed” by the unexpected attacks and was working with all sides to head off a new surge in violence.“I condemn the deaths of civilians in the Israeli airstrikes,” said Tor Wennesland, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. “This is unacceptable.”The IDF said that the airstrikes had been planned since the recent rocket fire and that the timing was guided by weather and intelligence on the militant commanders’ movements.“What we wanted to achieve, we achieved,” Hecht said. “We don’t know where it will go. We are ready for as long as it takes.”About 40 helicopters and planes took part in the strikes. In addition to the locations of the Islamic Jihad targets, they hit several sites that Israel said were militant infrastructure, including a rocket-manufacturing site in the Khan Younis refugee camp and a cement plant.Israel said the three militant leaders were involved in orchestrating recent attacks on Israel and planning for future ones. They were killed while in apartments — two in Gaza City, in the enclave’s crowded north, and one in Rafah to the south — and the strikes were designed for “pinpoint” precision, Hecht said.Young Palestinians arm themselves for a new era of violent resistanceBut in Gaza’s densely packed neighborhoods, surrounding buildings and apartments are frequently damaged in strikes. Images shared by Palestinian civil defense groups showed teams in Rafah and Gaza City working to rescue people trapped in the debris. Photos circulating on social media showed dead and wounded civilians, including children said to have been relatives of the targeted men. The Washington Post could not immediately verify the images.Among the civilians reported killed was a prominent dentist, Jamal Khaswan, along with his wife and son. The IDF said Khaswan was not a target but was apparently in a nearby apartment.Violence has intensified this year between Israel and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza under Netanyahu’s new government, sworn in in December.Settler leaders who are part of the hard-line government have advocated policies to expand Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. In April, there were fears of a regional war after Palestinian militant groups in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza fired rockets into Israel, prompting retaliatory airstrikes.This year has been one of the deadliest in recent memory for Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank. Since January, at least 95 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces or settlers. At least 17 Israelis and one foreign national have been killed by Palestinians.Rubin reported from Tel Aviv, and Masih from Seoul.

      "title": "The famed Mavericks surfing contest drowned in acrimony. Can it be saved?",
      "text": "HALF MOON BAY, Calif. — The wave roars like a dozen cannons as it climbs four stories high, casting the few bold enough to surf its crest into a teeming pit of frigid, shark-filled ocean. It costs nothing to paddle the half-mile from Pillar Point through surging sea and up a liquid mountain that has slain two of the most gifted men to ride a surfboard. Daring death has no price tag, even if people keep trying to find one.For decades, almost no one knew this spot existed; its beauty was hidden by a bluff along the road between San Francisco and Monterey. The few locals who realized it was there resisted the wave’s seductive curl, fearing their boards would be splintered and they would be hurled onto nearby rocks.Since the rest of the world discovered the site known as Mavericks in the early 1990s, those who surf here are drawn by the euphoria and danger of proving themselves on what has become one of the world’s fiercest big waves. They tell stories of being thrown face-first into surging ocean, of being sucked beneath the surface or caught on the underwater reef, uncertain if the moment was their last — only to say they couldn’t wait to try it again.“It’s like a really scary roller coaster,” said Sarah Gerhardt, the first woman to surf Mavericks. “You go up and up and up, and you know what’s coming, and then it drops and you’re like, ‘Ahhhhhhhh!’ ”But as the surf’s appeal boomed, so did a desire to make money off its power, mainly in an annual one-day surfing contest that became a global sensation, bringing big crowds to the beach and bluffs around Pillar Point and more recently drawing millions more to watch online. For those devoted to big wave surfing, the Mavericks contest became a kind of Super Bowl, a one-day survival test for a handful of the world’s very best surfers, held only when the waves were the right height, with just the right wind and perfect visibility, which meant it happened just 10 times between 1999 and 2016.Then, for reasons ranging from politics to small-town territorial disputes to gender equity debates, it hasn’t occurred since. An event that has propelled many surfers into stardom has dissolved into a string of financial debacles filled with complaints about delayed prize payments, broken promises and a bankruptcy.“You have this Yosemite of a wave, and it’s blemished by lawsuits,” said surfer and filmmaker Grant Washburn, who has competed in every Mavericks contest.The contest’s best hope of happening again is a 24-year-old woman in San Francisco who doesn’t surf and is locked in a distant verbal battle with the event’s founder, a man she has met only once. Mostly using money from a college internship and the salary from her first job, Elizabeth Cresson has obtained the permits to run a Mavericks contest, including perhaps the most important: a five-year lease with the California State Lands Commission that has been at the center of much of Mavericks’ recent troubles.Cresson says she wants to do this because she grew up near Half Moon Bay, a place her grandfather and father helped develop, and she wants to help local businesses by putting on an event that “won’t be an embarrassment.” But she also wants to do this because as a teenager she was appalled by what she saw as a contest that glorified an exclusionary cabal of surfer dudes who resented women on their waves and defined the world’s best surfers as the world’s best male surfers. She wants her Mavericks contest to look exactly like the Olympic surfing competition, with equal divisions and prize money for men and women. And she wants to have it as soon as the next open season between November and March, when the perfect swells race across the Pacific.“Women are equal participants in the [Half Moon Bay] economy, and that wasn’t what was happening with the competition,” she said.A half-hour drive north of Half Moon Bay, Cresson sits at an outdoor table in San Francisco’s Hayes Valley trying to figure out how she can get $1 million. Since acquiring the World Surf League’s abandoned rights to hold the contest in 2019, while she was still a student at Georgetown University, she has found a partner for the project in Paul Taublieb, an extreme sports documentary maker and event promoter. But after looking at the costs — from tens of thousands of dollars for permits, marketing and operating costs and the $100,000 purse — Cresson realizes she needs $1 million to run the event.“Or at least $750,000,” she says.Cresson, who works in the finance department at Slack, knew it would be hard to bring back Mavericks, but she hadn’t imagined the pandemic that wiped out any hope of a contest in the winters of 2021 and 2022. She had hopes for this year until the economy changed and potential sponsors who once sounded enthusiastic started using phrases such as, “We’re holding off until 2024,” and, “Our budgets are already set.”Still, she remains determined. Since taking over the coastal commission lease, she has acquired a long list of permits to hold the contest, a process she calls “byzantine.” With three more years on the lease, she is confident that corporate budgets won’t always be tight and that if she keeps pushing the money will appear.“She doesn’t just have the keys to the car,” Taublieb says of the permits. “She has the whole car.”Securing permits is not the same as dancing with death at Mavericks, however, and Cresson is paddling into perilous waters. Though she grew up a few miles outside Half Moon Bay and her grandfather helped develop the town in the 1980s and her father, George, keeps an office in the village’s downtown, she is an outsider to the clique of surfers who have made Mavericks their own. Surfing, especially in the small towns along the California coast, is a territorial sport in which each spot is governed by its own codes.Rules are often unspoken but intimately known to those who come there every day, and the culture is often contradictory. While newcomers are welcomed, there’s also a mistrust of outsiders. Things can get violent. In recent years, female surfers have been accepted, even encouraged, but it’s hard for surfers to trust anyone from the corporate world, let alone a woman who has never ridden a wave.Cresson’s idealism is crashing hard against an establishment where control is confined to a small group of surfers who have dedicated their lives to one prestigious wave.“Oh, my gosh, she has no clue,” Jeff Clark says.No one knows Mavericks better than Clark, who built his life around the wave since the early 1960s, when his family moved to Half Moon Bay. He grew up hearing the story about the three men from San Francisco who stopped at the barren beach by Pillar Point and tried to surf the raging sea, then named the strip of sand after their dog, Maverick. For much of his childhood, Clark sat on Mavericks Beach, mesmerized by the wave that few dared to surf. And after he finally did, in the 1970s, he rode it mostly by himself for the next 15 years.Some call Clark “The Mayor of Mavericks.” At his Mavericks Surf Company in a small strip of stores beside the local harbor, he sells his custom Jeff Clark surfboards, and from the bench in front, you can see the top of the wave crashing in the distance.Clark welcomed the new surfers when they started to arrive in the early 1990s, and he was there when Hawaiian surfing star Mark Foo died surfing the wave in 1994 — the moment that sealed Mavericks’ menacing reputation.After executives from Quiksilver approached a few years later, the first two Mavericks competitions were held in 1999 and 2000, garnering coverage from global news outlets and using the tagline “Men Who Ride Mountains.” But then Quiksilver pulled out, shifting its focus to contests in Hawaii.Clark later joined with Keir Beadling, an entrepreneur from San Francisco with a marketing degree from Duke who spent eight years trying to build Mavericks into an enterprise, with a clothing line and a high-end webcast. Then in 2014, Clark partnered with Griffin Guess, a hip-hop producer and marketer who helped promote albums for Kanye West and Jay-Z. Guess’s company, Cartel, ran the last contest in 2016.But the pairings ended badly, often in disputes that spilled out in public hearings and made headlines across the Bay Area. Despite the contest’s growing popularity — “Mavericks is like the 49ers around here,” Washburn says — the contest always seemed to be teetering financially.“Jeff decided that if anyone is going to make money off of Mavericks, it should be him,” says Mark Kreidler, author of “Voodoo Wave,” a book about Mavericks and the contest.The ugliest dispute was the last one, in 2016, when Clark alleges Guess and Cartel’s executives took his name off the permit applications, “stealing” the contest from him. Brian Waters, who ran the event for Guess, said he “has no comment about the business process.”Sally Jenkins: The surfer, the scientist and the big-wave beach at a breaking pointWhen Cartel declared bankruptcy a year later, the contest’s rights were sold out of bankruptcy court to the World Surfing League for $500,000.The WSL never held a contest and finally abandoned the rights in 2019, which is when Cresson went to the California State Lands Commission and got the lease for the cost of an application and processing fee.“And during this time, we had a very, like, insanely activist, feminist just going off on us,” Clark says. “Sabrina Brennan … she’s the reason the contest didn’t happen for six years.”Brennan, who moved to the neighborhood on top of Pillar Point’s bluff not long before the first Mavericks contest, probably has battled Clark more than anyone over the years. Her anger goes back to those first weeks in her new home when she saw a big story about the coming competition in the local paper under the headline: “Men Who Ride Mountains.”“What about women who ride mountains?” she thought.At the time, Brennan was an avid snowboarder with a creative design business and a side interest in pushing for equality in women’s sports. Though she really doesn’t surf, her wife does, and as she watched the all-male Mavericks contest over the years, she became more outraged.Brennan pulled some of the best female surfers together, started a group called Surf Equity and stormed after surfing’s male establishment, demanding equal competitions with equal pay for women.“There was this discrimination right in my backyard,” she says.The topic of women and surfing has always been complicated. Gerhardt, the first woman to surf Mavericks, has felt generally welcome at the surf spot and fondly remembers how Clark, Washburn and her husband, Mike (also a big wave surfer), joyously lofted her over their heads the first time she rode a wave. And yet she was never motivated much to push to be in contests, in part because they “are boys clubs, and where do I fit in that?”Likewise, several of the men who surf at Mavericks say they have always welcomed women and are supportive of women not only surfing there but competing in contests. But in a sport where even the best surfers fight to make a living on small scraps of prize and endorsement money, every spot in a contest is sacred, and adding women means cutting out top men. Plus, Clark said some of the women didn’t want to try some of the most dangerous surf or compete with the men.“I mean, there’s a reason there’s a WNBA and NBA, you know, and the feminists and activists don’t want to hear that,” Clark says.Cresson, then in high school, watched Brennan’s fight play out in the local papers and television news and was inspired. She began talking with her father about trying to run the contest herself, with divisions for men and women. After the California legislature passed a bill in 2019 that required all events held on state land to have equal participation with equal prize money, the WSL walked away from the rights, and father and daughter got serious.“They think women are going to suck and you will have less skilled [surfers],” Cresson said of Clark and others long involved with the contest. “And, like, maybe they’re less skilled because they [aren’t allowed to] actually compete.”From in front of his shop, Clark shakes his head.“All the women that have come here, they get in your face and they scream as loud as they can instead of coming up and going: ‘Hey, you know, we’d like to see women in this. How can we work together to make that happen?’ ” he says. “Never has that been said ever.”Mostly, though, Clark and others with the contest resent Cresson’s tone in interviews, such as the video conversation she did last year with Surf Equity in which she called the dispute over women’s inclusion at Mavericks “one of the few things around her that felt so obviously, like, discriminatory” and said the only people unhappy that she is running Mavericks are “the people who had it before I had it, so you know [they’re] not too jazzed.”“It’s like somebody’s daddy bought me a surf contest,” Washburn says. “It’s full of this entitlement.”Washburn says he believes women should compete in surfing contests and has arranged informal events for female surfers in the area. He says his concern is about the fact that Mavericks is one of the world’s most treacherous waves — it’s where Foo and another top surfer, Sion Milosky, died — and he is terrified that Cresson and Taublieb don’t have a plan for safety and control. After years of watching outsiders try to monetize Mavericks, he sees another organizer who doesn’t get what Mavericks really is, what riding its waves really means.Cresson and Taublieb insist they have thought a lot about details, running through their ideas for safety patrols and crowd controls. But none of this can be finalized without sponsors.“I have been totally open with people I’ve been talking to, but I have nothing to sell,” Taublieb says. “The minute it’s real, then let’s talk about it.”For years, Bianca Valenti, a top female big wave surfer who has fought to compete in contests, has watched people battle over the contest at Mavericks. She is exhausted by it.“It’s like the Hunger Games,” she says. “Instead of helping each other, they eat each other. When people start behaving out of their trauma or their fears, they stop thinking straight.”Valenti says she is rooting for Cresson and likes that she hasn’t backed down.“The hardest part is just going for it,” Valenti says.Last year, Cresson and Taublieb went to a local bar where many of the Mavericks surfers hang out, hoping to talk to Clark and others involved in the contest, putting herself in front to them as if to say, “Here I am in the flesh, like devil incarnate.” But aside from shaking a few hands and saying “Nice to meet you,” she felt ignored. The surfers talked to Taublieb, and that was it.“It’s better that way,” she said. “I don’t want to have some sort of confrontation. Like, I’m not here to get in a fight with people. I just want to have a competition.”For now, the lone event at Mavericks is a digital contest Clark runs called Mavericks Awards in which surfers are filmed each day riding the wave and a panel picks the winners at the end of the season.It’s something, but it’s still not the mighty Mavericks contest that helped make the wave famous worldwide. Still, it forces the crux of the issue: With the financial challenges and uncertainty of when the perfect waves will come, is a real event even viable?Taublieb pauses and considers the question.“I don’t know,” he finally says.Early last year, he and Cresson had lined up Outside as a media provider, but they weren’t able to lock in any other major sponsors.“You can’t take someone’s money and then [say], ‘Oh, oopsies, we didn’t raise the other 500k,’ ” Cresson says. “You can’t really do that. We had a couple of big fish and then it just … you know.”A late-afternoon wind picks up in the San Francisco park where she sits, uncertain if this contest she has dreamed of holding will ever happen. A half-hour to the south, the Mavericks wave breaks near Pillar Point, as it has for thousands of years and probably will for thousands more. Surging, rising, falling and crashing again and again and again; unable to be controlled, unable to be bought.As always, free.",

      "title": "An archaeologist saw shapes in the water. They led to a submerged grave.",
      "text": "From aboard a seaplane in 2016, Josh Marano looked down over the Dry Tortugas and saw something strange. Underneath the clear waters of the coastal Florida national park was a series of dots arranged in an orderly L-shape. The pattern didn’t look natural, he thought.He put aside the hunch until years later. Finally, in August, Marano assembled a small research team to dive to the site and investigate what he’d seen. The dots turned out to be old building foundations that stood on a now-submerged island. Near them was a slab of sandstone, covered in seaweed and inscribed with gothic lettering: “John Greer” and “Nov. 5. 1861.”Marano had discovered a Civil War-era tombstone, buried in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Key West. With it came a mystery: Who was Greer, and how did he die?“It was surreal,” Marano said. “It’s the equivalent of finding a bell on a shipwreck with the name on it. It’s just something that you absolutely never hear of in underwater archaeology.”The National Park Service announced the discovery on May 1 after Marano and his team completed additional research about Greer and his burial site. They determined through historical records that Greer, a civilian laborer, was buried on the submerged island near the Dry Tortugas’ landmark fortress, Fort Jefferson. The island once housed a quarantine hospital and a cemetery that probably still contains the remains of dozens of American service members.On a group of islands known for snorkeling, shipwrecks and military history, Greer’s headstone is a link to the overshadowed stories of workers — both employed and enslaved — who built Fort Jefferson and once called the Dry Tortugas home, Marano said.“It kind of opens the door to a lesser-documented history that we’re hoping to highlight,” Marano said.Sunken treasures are essential to the mythos of the Dry Tortugas. The string of islands was a hub of piracy in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the seabed is strewn with shipwrecks from treasure fleets.But there was no gold or silver to plunder when Marano and a small team of researchers dived into the park’s waters in August to investigate his observation from years earlier. What they found instead harked back to a subsequent chapter in the Dry Tortugas’ history, when the U.S. military built a strong presence on the islands to better defend the Gulf of Mexico.In 1846, construction began on a sprawling brick fortress, Fort Jefferson, that remains today as the national park’s landmark attraction. During the Civil War, Fort Jefferson became a prison that most famously housed Samuel Mudd, a doctor convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Other structures were built on the islands surrounding Fort Jefferson to complement the growing population on the Tortugas, according to the National Park Service. Before beginning their dive, Marano and his team determined through historical records that his observation corresponded with the location of a submerged island that once contained a hospital.Marano’s team first found pylons jutting out from the sand, just beneath the water’s surface. They were about to swim away from the site when Devon Fogarty, an archaeology student on Marano’s team, spotted a slab of sandstone nearby. Marano cut away several strands of seaweed growing from the rock and revealed the lettering underneath. The team was shocked.“We had no idea, like there was no inkling,” Fogarty said. “We knew that there are cemeteries out there, that there are grave plots, but we didn’t expect anything to be preserved.”Sand islands in the Dry Tortugas can grow, shrink and shift in location as they’re buffeted by the elements, Marano said. But the complete submerging of an island is rarer. The island’s disappearance was accelerated by climate change and major storms that have swept through the region, the National Park Service said.Marano’s team determined that Greer’s grave was part of a cemetery on the island for service members stationed at Fort Jefferson and for civilians. But they didn’t want to announce news of the discovery before learning more about Greer and his life, Marano said. So he and Fogarty embarked on a new hunt: an arduous search through reams of archived records to find Greer’s name and any hint of the person he was.They struck out at several archives in Florida. In November, Fogarty traveled to the National Archives in Washington to try again. There, she finally made a breakthrough: Greer was listed as a White laborer in 1857 who’d built scaffolding during the fort’s construction. That hinted at the hardships that could have led to his death, Fogarty said. She theorized — based on the fact that Greer did not appear in hospital records — that he could have died in a sudden accident while on the job.“He was working in a very dangerous occupation, building very unsafe scaffolding to take up all those construction materials,” Fogarty said.Marano and Fogarty were unsuccessful in attempts to find descendants of Greer, they said, though they hope news of the discovery will encourage any relatives of people who’d lived on the islands to share any personal records from the period.The team plans to continue research on the submerged island, which is now recognized as a federally protected archaeological site, Marano said. Questions remain about the nature of Greer’s death, the lives of those buried with him and the numerous enslaved laborers who also helped build Fort Jefferson.Marano and Fogarty hope to answer them. They see it as a reversal of sorts for the history of a fort named after Thomas Jefferson.“We want to be able to establish that we can put the extra effort into remembering regular people,” Fogarty said.",

      "title": "Perspective | Vida Blue gave all of himself. He deserved more in return.",
      "text": "“I’m just some guy that threw a damn baseball. What’s the big deal about that?” — Vida Blue, June 24, 2021Vida Blue was one of those athletes born in the wrong generation. When he climbed atop his first major league mound in 1969, armed with an exploding fastball and saddled with a boyish innocence the game would slowly and painfully peel away, there was no such thing as player empowerment. Some owners acted as if they owned not only the team but also the people wearing the uniform. The I-can-buy-a-rocket-ship kind of money that stars earn today would have seemed like a fantasy for Blue and his contemporaries. While dominating in his first full season with the Oakland Athletics in 1971 on his way to winning the American League Cy Young and MVP awards, Blue lived in the projects because that’s what he could afford.He was born too soon. And when he died Saturday at 73, Blue didn’t have millions in the bank. He once owned a house in the Oakland Hills, but at the end he didn’t have a home of his own. He left here with little in material possessions, although he had given so much of himself away.With a name such as that and a left arm that worked miracles, naturally he became a fan favorite. Decades after his career had ended and the height of his celebrity had faded, he tried his best to live up to the memories. When he autographed memorabilia, he would sign his name along with, “Thank you for being a fan,” which he thought they would get a kick out of. When he shook hands, he would linger and turn small talk into an art form. They say you should never meet your idols, but that wasn’t true for those lucky enough to have called Vida Blue their childhood hero. He would make sure there was space for two on the pedestal.From 2021: Vida Blue wears his battle scarsFor some time, he had been paid to be one of those player-ambassador types for the San Francisco Giants: “All I do is go around, freeloading, drinking free beer and kissing babies and s---,” Blue once told me. He was either joking or being brutally honest — I couldn’t tell which. Certainly he was downplaying his role, limiting the impact he had on people. He often did that when we talked about his life for a 2021 profile. Maybe that was his defense mechanism — to play the part of the ex-ballplayer humbled by his own transgressions. Or maybe he was used to speaking that way because he came of age at a time when a small-town boy from Louisiana knew better than to make a fuss.When Blue was a boy, race wasn’t talked about. It was just known. He never asked his parents why he couldn’t swim in the Mansfield city pool; he just understood. When he was growing up, picking cotton was still an option Black children considered if they wanted to make some money on their own. So because his mother cleaned the homes of White families on the other side of town and his father worked at a steel mill — the work that would lead him to an early grave — Blue couldn’t dare ask for the luxury of a baseball glove. If he wanted to buy one, he would have to earn it at the cotton fields. He was never taught about money — only that he had to work for his.He could have gone to college for football, but he chose baseball because the family — his widowed mother and five siblings — needed the $25,000 signing bonus assured to him after being drafted. He was just a country boy and a little square: When a spring training roommate lit up a joint, he would yell at him to crack a window. He knew teammates in the minor leagues who smoked pot, but he didn’t partake. All he wanted to do was make a living. The only way he knew how was to become the most dominant pitcher in the world.By 1971, he did. But when a boy grows up with the lesson that hard work leads to rewards, only to discover that fairness doesn’t always follow that same logical path, disappointment follows.Certain aspects of American life have been force-fed to minorities. That your work should speak for you. That if you’re good enough, you can wedge open the doors of opportunity and privilege. Blue bought into that dream. And after his breakout season, he went to the negotiating table with A’s owner Charlie Finley and let his achievements speak for him. Years later, when Blue recalled the memory to me, he still seemed hurt. He said Finley quoted his statistics back to him … 24-8 record … 1.82 ERA … 24 complete games … eight shutouts … and none of it mattered.“He says this, almost to my face: ‘I don’t have to pay you nothing.’ And that’s like a dagger, man, in the heart,” Blue said.He could never understand why his work wasn’t good enough. Those wounds never healed, not even 50 years later. That period in his life seemed to change Blue. He wasn’t such an innocent anymore. He got into drugs and was swept up in baseball’s cocaine dragnet of the 1980s. He went to federal prison and spent the remaining years of his career trying to clean up his reputation and believing once again that if only he worked hard enough, he would get what he was worth.“You fight like hell to reestablish your name in a credible way because when you’re late for a game, [people say,] ‘Oh, he must be on the pipe,’ ” Blue told me. “You can’t be late for s---. If you’re 10 minutes early, you’re still late.“It’s the baggage,” he said. “The baggage will always be with this.”Baseball is confronting a decline in African American players. The stories of these nine athletes demonstrate why.And it followed him throughout his life. Blue never made it to the Hall of Fame, partially because of the drugs that interrupted his career. He was so honest when he shared that disappointment with me. The people who loved him most were heartbroken, too. Last summer, his longtime friend Michelle Lewis called me for advice in finding ways that she could get Blue back on the ballot. Her cause was an urgent one because she knew he didn’t have long.Pretty cool to watch a ball game with Vida Blue.Here he goes before every hitter in the 1st inning On Altuve: “He’s a first-pitch, fastball hitter.” He hits HR on the 1st pitch On Brantley: “Professional hitter” Hits a dblOn Bergman: “Pulls the ball” Dbl down left field line pic.twitter.com/M3zcmCHamkLewis is the founder of Oakland’s Northern Light School, which aims to provide underserved students with a private school education. Back in 2008, Blue came to the school as a speaker as part of his baseball ambassador gig, but then he came back two weeks later on his own — and he kept coming back. He served hot lunches, tutored in social studies classes, mentored any lefties who wanted to pitch and helped raise money for the school by going around, drinking beer and kissing babies during his namesake celebrity golf tournament. When Blue needed a place to stay a few years back, Lewis and her daughter, Caitlin Alegre, took him in as a roommate.“He was for real,” Lewis said. “He was a people person, and he went out of his way to be there for others.”When Blue died, Lewis was nearly 3,000 miles away. Northern Light’s annual eighth-grade trip to D.C. was on the schedule. Blue usually accompanied the students on the trip, as he did a year ago. This time, however, Lewis had to go without him.Lewis spent Sunday wandering around the National Museum of African American History and Culture in a daze but once again determined. She’s trying to find some way to get one of Blue’s artifacts into the museum. To her, and the people who loved him, he’s more than just some guy who threw a baseball. He’s a man who deserved more than what he got.",

      "text": "Former congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who has vowed to do everything she can to keep Donald Trump from returning to the White House, launched a television ad Tuesday warning viewers that the former president “is a risk America can never take again.”The ad is running on CNN before and during a high-profile town hall scheduled Wednesday night on CNN featuring Trump — now a 2024 candidate — taking questions from voters in New Hampshire.The 60-second spot, which Cheney narrates but in which she does not appear, is funded by her political action committee.

      "title": "Arrest of Imran Khan, Pakistan’s former prime minister, prompts violent clashes ",
      "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan’s main opposition leader and former prime minister, Imran Khan, was arrested Tuesday, authorities said, raising the stakes of the country’s political crisis and sparking clashes between his supporters and police.The arrest prompted demonstrations across the country, and widespread internet outages were reported. Security forces deployed tear gas and water cannons in confrontations with Khan supporters in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and other cities. The former prime minister’s party claimed that several protesters were killed and dozens injured. Authorities did not immediately release their own figures.Some demonstrators targeted military sites — a rare focus in a country where the military wields substantial power.Khan was ousted by parliament last April after, according to his allies, the military dropped its support for him. Public disputes between Khan, the military and the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had mounted in intensity over the past days, after Khan accused a senior officer of involvement in an assassination attempt against him in November, which he narrowly survived. Military and government officials have strongly denied those claims.Khan, who is expected to run in general elections later this year, has described himself for months as the victim of a plot. Several attempts to arrest him failed, including one in March that resulted in violent clashes.Pakistani authorities said Khan’s arrest on Tuesday was linked to a corruption and money laundering case that has been evolving for months. The former prime minister also faces a number of other charges in separate cases, all of which he has rejected.Pakistani authorities said they had unsuccessfully sought Khan’s cooperation in the corruption probe. He was subsequently arrested by officers on high court premises in the capital, Islamabad, where he was to attend hearings linked to different cases on Tuesday.Pakistani police battle protesters in attempt to arrest opposition leaderFootage distributed by Khan’s party showed the opposition leader being pushed into a law enforcement vehicle. Officials said the arresting officers — members of a paramilitary force — were operating on a warrant from the country’s anti-corruption watchdog.They denied accusations from Khan’s allies that the former prime minister was beaten during his arrest. Neither side immediately provided evidence to back its claims.As he left his residence in the city of Lahore to attend the scheduled court hearings in Islamabad early Tuesday, Khan released a video message in which he said he is “ready to go to jail,” but added that the accusations against him are unsubstantiated.Later, in a response to Khan on Twitter, Sharif, the prime minister, accused his predecessor of “blatant lies, untruths, U-turns, and vicious attacks on institutions.” He charged that Khan was bending “the judiciary to your whims and behaving as if rules don’t apply to you.”But members of Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Movement for Justice, say they suspect the timing of his arrest suggests it is politically motivated. The government has repeatedly sought to delay key regional votes this year after Khan performed above expectations in by-elections last October, and it recently appeared to run out of options to stall further, its critics say.The country’s deteriorating economic situation has become the top concern among many voters, with the current government and Khan trading blame over the root causes of the crisis. Financial experts fear that the country may be on the verge of defaulting on its international loans.Amir Khan, a 28-year-old who protested in support of the former prime minister’s release in Peshawar on Tuesday, said radical measures are needed to confront Pakistan’s mounting challenges.“This time we will teach the government a lesson,” he said, adding that a “revolution is needed to restore civilian leadership.”“If a leader and former prime minister is not safe, how could a common citizen be protected?” asked Ihtesham ul Haq, a 22-year old civil engineer who also attended the protest.Noack reported from Doha, Qatar, and Nawaz Khan from Peshawar, Pakistan.",

      "title": "How countries around the world have responded to mass shootings",
      "text": "The slaying of eight people by a gunman in Allen, Tex., over the weekend turned attention once again to the staggering scope of mass shootings in the United States, which has seen more than 200 this year alone.U.S. mass shootings are on the rise, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group. But in many countries, they are rare — and lead to drastic change when they unfold.There have been more than 200 mass shootings so far this yearAfter two back-to-back mass shootings in early May, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic pledged to disarm the country, proposing gun-control measures. “We will carry out an almost total disarmament of Serbia,” he said in an address to the country. “We must make a decision to confront this evil.”He is not alone: While gun-control measures remain a bitter partisan political issue in the United States, they are widespread elsewhere.From Britain to New Zealand, here are the policy changes some countries have implemented after their own mass shootings.Serbia president vows to disarm nation after two mass shootingsIn August 1987, Michael Robert Ryan fatally shot 16 people in Hungerford, England. The scale of the massacre shocked the country. At the time, The Washington Post described it as the “worst such incident in modern British history.”Ryan, 27 and unemployed, was armed with a Chinese copy of an AK-47 and a variety of other guns. His motive was never discovered. He killed himself and his mother, his only close relative.In response to the massacre, British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd called for an investigation into Ryan’s legal ownership of the guns he used. The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, passed with the backing of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party government, outlawed semiautomatic weapons and limited sales of some types of shotguns.These weapons were rare in Britain, so the impact was limited. But after another shooting in March 1996, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and their teacher at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland using Browning and Smith & Wesson handguns, more-sweeping rules were put in place.Public anger over the killings led to a powerful grass-roots campaign called Snowdrop. The 1997 Firearms Act ended up restricting ownership of almost all handguns. Tens of thousands of guns were collected from owners, who were given market value for the weapons. Police spent years cracking down on illegal gun ownership.Gun violence peaked in 2005 and has generally declined in the years since.Relatives of those who died in Britain’s mass shootings have said their experiences could help the United States reckon with gun-control legislation.“Eyes are going to be on Dunblane, and we don’t need the eyes on Dunblane anymore,” Jack Crozier, whose 5-year-old sister Emma was killed in the massacre, said at an anniversary event in March 2021. “But we need to be looking at what is going on in other countries, and America in particular.”What we know about the victims of the Buffalo grocery store shootingMartin Bryant, 29, killed 35 people near the historical Port Arthur prison in Tasmania, Australia, using a legally purchased Colt AR-15 semiautomatic rifle in April 1996. It was the deadliest massacre in Australia during the 20th century and came just weeks after the killings in Dunblane.The slayings drew widespread attention to Australia’s gun laws, which were especially relaxed in Tasmania. The island, which has its own state government, had required gun licenses only since 1988 and did not require rifles to be registered.The Australian federal government, then led by center-right Prime Minister John Howard, coordinated with states to restrict the ownership of automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. Within a year, the government bought back 650,000 firearms.Some studies have indicated that the program was successful and that Australia became a less violent place in the years since the buyback.In 2013, Howard wrote an op-ed for the New York Times that called on President Barack Obama to follow his model. “Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control,” Howard wrote.U.N. leader denounces Buffalo mass shooting as ‘vile act’ of racist violenceIn March 2019, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and killed 51 Muslim worshipers with weapons that included an AR-15-style rifle. Less than 24 hours later, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the country would change its gun laws.Unlike Australia, New Zealand had relatively lax gun regulations and a powerful gun lobby. Before the attack, there were an estimated 250,000 gun owners in the country, which has a population of 5 million people. Tarrant, an Australian citizen who had been living in New Zealand since 2017, had purchased his weapons legally, although he had illegally modified some.Ardern was able to gather swift support for tougher gun laws, putting temporary measures in place within days. The following month, Parliament made the changes official, with overwhelming bipartisan support and only one lawmaker opposed. Among the plans were a gun buyback scheme, as well as restrictions on AR-15s and other semiautomatic weapons.Because of the lax tracking of these weapons, authorities were initially unsure how many were in the country. “It’s really an open checkbook,” Joe Green, gun-safety specialist and former arms control manager for the New Zealand Police, told The Post, “because they don’t know how many they are buying back.”A second round of gun laws was passed in 2020, which required setting up a new firearms registry that gun license holders were required to update as they bought or sold firearms.In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in May 2019, Ardern said she was bewildered by the United States’ reluctance to pass gun-control laws. “Australia experienced a massacre and changed their laws. New Zealand had its experience and changed its laws. To be honest with you, I do not understand the United States,” she said.In April 2020, Gabriel Wortman, dressed in an authentic Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform and driving a mocked-up police cruiser, went on a 13-hour rampage through rural Nova Scotia, killing 22 people in the deadliest shooting in modern Canadian history.Police shot the 51-year-old denturist dead at a gas station. Court documents showed that he was armed with two semiautomatic rifles and two pistols. He did not have a firearms license, and some of the weapons were smuggled in from the United States.Two weeks later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a ban on more than 1,500 makes and models of “military-style assault weapons,” including the AR-15 and the Ruger Mini-14, which was used in a 1989 massacre that left 14 dead at the École Polytechnique in Montreal. The ban makes it illegal to fire, transport, sell, import or bequeath those weapons.Trudeau, who pledged stricter gun-control measures during the 2019 election campaign, said his government had been working on a ban before the pandemic. The Conservative Party said the ban, which was imposed through regulatory measures, was opportunistic.An amnesty measure to allow people a grace period to comply was set to expire in April, but it has been extended through the fall of 2023. The government has pledged to develop a mandatory buyback program for the banned firearms, but there are few details on how it would work.Júlia Ledur contributed to this report, which has been updated.",

      "title": "Longtime Blackhawks star Patrick Kane joins Rangers in long-awaited trade",
      "text": "After 16 seasons in Chicago, Blackhawks star Patrick Kane is on the move. The three-time Stanley Cup winner was traded to the New York Rangers on Tuesday night, with Chicago receiving two draft picks and two defensemen in return.The Blackhawks will receive a conditional second-round pick in the 2023 draft and a fourth-round pick in 2025, the team announced. Chicago will handle 50 percent of Kane’s remaining salary. The Arizona Coyotes will take on 25 percent of his salary to facilitate the deal, receiving a third-round draft pick from New York in return. Neither defenseman heading to Chicago in the trade is in the NHL; Andy Welinski plays in the American Hockey League, and Vili Saarijarvi plays in Switzerland. New York also received AHL defenseman Cooper Zech from Chicago.We have traded Patrick Kane for a conditional 2023 second round pick, a 2025 fourth round pick and defenseman Andy Welinski from the New York Rangers.We’ve also acquired defenseman Vili Saarijarvi from Arizona as part of the trade. pic.twitter.com/5px44LHOvEThe long-rumored deal came three days before Friday’s trade deadline and ended weeks of speculation about Kane’s future. The 34-year-old winger was set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season, and the Blackhawks, tied for last in the Western Conference at 21-33-5, have stated they are entering a rebuilding period.“We’re going to look at more of a rebuild here,” General Manager Kyle Davidson told NBC Sports Chicago last March. “There are some things that we really need to fix that are going to take time. We’re not going to put a timeline on it, whether it’s three, five [years] — I don’t have that answer right now. That will be determined as we proceed.”Svrluga: For Ovechkin in winter, a deadline sell-off makes sense for the Capitals this springKane, the No. 1 pick in 2007, has played well this season, tallying 16 goals and 29 assists in 54 games. Those numbers add to his robust career totals: In 1,161 games for the Blackhawks, Kane had 446 goals and 779 assists. In addition to the Stanley Cup titles, Kane — a nine-time All-Star Game selection — has won the Hart Trophy as the NHL MVP and the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in points.Kane is the second high-profile winger acquired by the Rangers in February. On Feb. 9, the St. Louis Blues shipped Vladimir Tarasenko and defenseman Niko Mikkola to New York for forward Sammy Blais, prospect Hunter Skinner, a conditional first-round pick in 2023 and a fourth-round choice in 2024.Some believed that deal might table the Kane talks, and the veteran himself had a negative reaction to the news.“It’s not like the happiest I’ve been to hear about a trade,” Kane later told reporters. “If things were going to happen, that was a team I was definitely looking at. It seems like they kind of filled their void and went ahead and made a deal. So it is what it is.”The Rangers, currently in third place in the Metropolitan Division, were not done. Kane, a Buffalo native, has a full no-trade clause in his contract, meaning he could choose his next destination. Last week, the Athletic reported Kane was only considering the Rangers in a potential move.“I’m so thankful for everything the city, the Blackhawks organization, my teammates and the fans have done for me and my family over the last 16 years — the support was constant from day one and Chicago will forever be home for us,” Kane said in a statement released by the Blackhawks. “... I look forward to this next step in my career and will forever be appreciative for all I have received from the Blackhawks and Chicago.”I will forever be proud to be a Blackhawk and call Chicago home.

      "title": "Perspective | For the long-patient Ted Leonsis, finally a Ted Talk to remember",
      "text": "Has someone checked on Ted Leonsis lately? Is he okay? Seriously, if there’s anyone available who can pull up to the gates of his Potomac mansion, ring the intercom and ask if all is well, that may put us all at ease. Just to make sure it was not a billion-dollar body double who sent that statement Wednesday — that it was in fact the real Ted Leonsis.Because that statement needed only three paragraphs to unleash some of the strongest words ever written by a Monumental Sports & Entertainment staffer. I would dare anyone across Washington Wizards fandom to read those short, pointed and overly dramatic italicized sentences out loud and not say: whoa. Although the statement didn’t come with sound effects or strobe lights, it landed in inboxes at exactly 7 p.m. with a boom and a feeling of shock that something so drastic, so — what’s the right word? — so very un-Ted-like had just happened.This wasn’t another Ted Talk. This was action.Wizards fire president and general manager Tommy SheppardOn Wednesday, Leonsis, the Monumental Sports & Entertainment founder and CEO, fired Tommy Sheppard. Days such as this don’t usually happen with the Wizards. Sheppard, who signed a contract extension less than two years ago, was the Wizards’ president and general manager and had been with the team since 2003. Even internal staffers, I’m told, were shocked by the news. They know as well as anyone that change doesn’t happen here.The only evolution in D.C. comes from the constantly remixed jerseys meant to milk a few more bucks from the last remaining die-hards. But there’s no change where it really matters. One season without 50 wins or an appearance in the conference finals builds atop the next. Mediocre stretches spiral into inferior eras. Ernie Grunfeld begets Tommy Sheppard. One blown draft pick morphs into another. And 25 years later, all that remains is a 1978 championship banner that hangs over a dead arena.Suddenly, however, Leonsis feels urgency for something fresh. All it took was his team missing the playoffs for two seasons, the “failure” of not even making the top 10 among 15 teams in the Eastern Conference. Leonsis’s statement described this as a “very disappointing” feeling for the organization and fans. Then came the sentence that changed everything:“A search for new leadership will begin immediately for an executive from outside the organization.”Leonsis ended the statement by wishing Sheppard good luck. But a more fitting salute would have been: “New Ted, who dis?”Yes, he waited nine days after Sheppard represented the organization during the end-of-season media availability. But in Leonsis Time, a week and a half felt like 28 seconds. For the Wizards, this almost looks like something that could be called intentional.This season, Monica Dixon, the company’s chief administrative officer, worked out of the team’s practice facility at Entertainment and Sports Arena in Ward 8, multiple people told me. The idea of Leonsis sending his right-hand woman inside the Wizards’ workplace should feel significant.Leonsis has a history of simply standing by and watching the franchise falter. He admitted his own need to “take responsibility” after he fired Grunfeld in 2019. Still, four years later, Leonsis doesn’t cut the image of a hands-on owner. He has been busy trying to buy the Nationals and possibly Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. Having Dixon work at ESA on a consistent basis, observe the Wizards’ situation, recognize what is and what is not working and report back should have given Leonsis a better understanding of his basketball team. Wise move by the boss.And this understanding led Leonsis to do something he has never done as the Wizards’ owner: finally slap a period at the end of the Grunfeld era.The line about finding an executive outside the organization sent a signal for fans to buckle up and brace for real change. It also should have communicated a stronger message internally: If you are currently employed by the Wizards, you need not apply. If there’s any trace of the past 20 years of residue on your fingerprints, like orange Cheetos stains you can’t wipe off, this job is not for you.Thank you for your service, all you Washington lifers and trusty Grunfeld lieutenants — or anyone who was in the room and signed off on drafting Johnny Davis with the 10th overall pick. But please, leave.The Wizards would rather have new blood, and I can’t imagine Leonsis made this decision without having someone already in mind, right? Right?! Even so, this scary unknown should feel good.Somewhere out there is Washington’s next president of basketball operations, who will come from a different NBA organization. Hopefully, this person brings along a vision, some excitement, maybe even a plan that can work around the are-you-kidding-me?!?! contract given to Bradley Beal. Sheppard and Leonsis did the organization no favors by giving Beal that no-trade clause in his five-year, $251 million deal. The next executive has to know how to work wonders around this nightmare or learn to coax more money out of Leonsis to build a roster around Beal.Bradley Beal can’t see the future, but he expects to be with the WizardsAnd on the topic of executives and money, it’s time again to daydream about Tim Connelly or even Bob Myers, the foreman behind the Golden State Warriors’ dynasty. Though Connelly’s name popped up immediately following the breaking news, the problem with the Minnesota Timberwolves’ president of basketball operations is he already turned down the Wizards in 2019. Less than a year ago, he signed a five-year contract worth $40 million with Minnesota.Though Myers is on an expiring deal, when he becomes available he will be worth more than Connelly’s number.And Masai Ujiri? Let’s not even fool ourselves with that fantasy again. Leonsis said he didn’t interview Ujiri during the team’s 2019 search, and Ujiri, as the Toronto Raptors’ president and vice chairman, has the title and all the power he wants north of the border. There’s a reason in 2019 he proclaimed: “I’m here to stay.”So maybe there won’t be a splashy name, but that shouldn’t diminish the enthusiasm of something new and garden-fresh coming to D.C.With his Wednesday announcement, Leonsis won the day on Twitter. And for a billionaire owner who actually cares about the comments section, that’s big for him. Now New Ted has to be bold and spend the money.Not on a long, drawn-out search process, as he did last time. No more world tours and interviews with Barack Obama, Billy Beane and a laundry list of other names. Last time, Leonsis tried something he felt was visionary in creating “Monumental Basketball.” He wanted to get it right, but it turned out to be completely unnecessary when, after all of that, Leonsis ended up with Sheppard — a symbol of the past who couldn’t last four full years on his own.Leonsis just needs to spend the appropriate amount of money to land a smart and innovative basketball executive. It seems he finally has the motivation for a different voice. Let’s just hope this New Ted has replaced the old version, the long-suffering owner averse to change..",

      "title": "Senate panel asks Crow for full accounting of gifts to Thomas, other justices",
      "text": "The Senate Judiciary Committee in a letter Monday asked billionaire Harlan Crow to provide a full accounting of the free travel and other gifts he has made to Clarence Thomas or any other Supreme Court justices, marking an escalation of the powerful committee’s efforts to convince the court to adopt stricter ethical standards for itself.Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and the committee’s 10 other Democrats signed on to the letter asking Crow to provide an itemized list of gifts worth more than $415 that he’s made to Thomas, any other justice or any justice’s family member, as well as a full list of lodging, transportation, real estate transactions and admission to any private clubs Crow may have provided.The Judiciary Committee is now the second Senate committee to target Crow after ProPublica reported that the Republican donor invited Thomas on pricey vacations, bought his mother’s house and provided Thomas’s grandnephew with private school tuition, most of which were not disclosed by the justice.The Judiciary Committee also sent letters Monday to three companies associated with the Republican donor’s travels that facilitated the private resort, private jet and superyacht travel where Thomas has joined Crow, asking those companies to provide a list of other guests whose travel overlapped with Thomas’s or that of any other justice.For example, the committee asked the company Topridge Holdings for a full list of guests who stayed at Camp Topridge — Crow’s private lakeside resort — while Thomas was there as a personal guest of Crow’s.Supreme Court justices are required to disclose gifts of over $415, but the rules around gifts involving personal hospitality were murkier. The Judicial Conference, the federal courts’ policymaking body, recently changed disclosure rules to require justices and other federal judges to report more details of gifts, including free stays at hotels or hunting lodges, and clarified that a ride on a private jet, for example, must be reported.“Regardless of the intentions behind these stays, if these gifts to Justice Thomas enabled those with interests before the Court to have private access to a Justice, it is a matter of significant public concern,” the senators wrote. The committee also asked for details about any stays that other Supreme Court justices may have had at the Adirondacks resort.Crow has said he never attempted to influence Thomas’s decision-making on the court, and Thomas said he believed he had been following the court’s disclosure rules.All 11 of the committee’s Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) — who on Tuesday announced she’s returning from a health-related months-long absence — signed the letters, and none of the committee’s Republicans joined.Feinstein’s return could expand Durbin’s options if Crow ignores the request for information by the committee’s May 22 deadline. Her absence from the Judiciary Committee has meant the committee’s Democrats lacked the votes to subpoena anyone, given unanimous Republican opposition to the idea. But in an interview with CNN on Sunday, Durbin did not rule out a subpoena, saying “everything is on the table.” He also said he was embarrassed for Thomas as news continued to drip out about his relationship with Crow and that he hoped Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would move on his own to institute stronger ethical standards for the court.“This is the Roberts court, and history is going to judge him by the decision he makes on this,” Durbin said. “He has the power to make the difference.”Durbin last month asked Roberts to appear in front of the committee, but the chief justice declined the request, saying it would be inappropriate given the separation of powers. Roberts also included a “Statement on Ethics Principles and Practices” signed by all nine justices that reaffirmed the disclosure and other rules they abide by, saying they’ve done so for decades.The letters to Crow and others are part of the committee’s efforts to craft legislation strengthening the ethical rules and standards that apply to Supreme Court justices. “The information gathered from these letters will help identify specific shortcomings in the ‘Statement on Ethics Principles and Practices’ that legislation needs to address,” committee spokeswoman Emily Hampsten said in a statement.Such legislation would likely face a tough time gaining Republican support, however, as Republicans in Congress have rallied to Thomas’s side. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Democrats want people to “gasp in horror” that Thomas vacations with his friends. Other Republicans have suggested Democrats are merely angry over the court’s conservative bent and recent decisions, including overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion.Yet the cascade of unflattering reports about Thomas and some other justices’ undisclosed potential conflicts of interest has fueled calls for ethics reform as polls suggest that Americans have declining trust in the institution. A conservative judicial activist, for example, paid Thomas’s wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, tens of thousands of dollars for consulting work just over a decade ago, specifying that her name be left off billing paperwork, The Washington Post reported last week.The reports have also put pressure on Durbin to take a more aggressive stance in pushing for court reform. Late last month, Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Crow to inform his committee whether Crow reported the gifts to Thomas on his taxes. The senator also said he would “explore using other tools at the committee’s disposal” to obtain the information if Crow did not respond by May 8. A spokesman for Wyden said Crow’s attorney  “refused to provide answers” to the committee in a response received late on Monday.Fewer than 4 in 10 Americans said they have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the Supreme Court, according to an NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll released late last month. In 2018, 59 percent said they had faith in the court.",

      "title": "Denny Crum, who led Louisville to two NCAA titles, dies at 86 ",
      "text": "Hall of Fame men’s college basketball coach Denny Crum, who led Louisville to two national titles in 30 seasons as the Cardinals’ head coach, passed away at his home Tuesday, the school announced. He was 86 and had suffered a number of strokes in recent years.We are saddened to share the passing of legendary UofL Basketball Coach Denny Crum.Our thoughts & prayers are with his loved ones.https://t.co/ceEJstxbw6 pic.twitter.com/hZlfKf04xMCrum became Louisville’s head coach in 1971 after serving as John Wooden’s top assistant at UCLA, his alma mater that was then in the midst of its years-long run as college basketball’s most dominant program. The hire paid off immediately, as the program reached the Final Four in Crum’s first season (the Cardinals lost to Wooden and the Bruins in the national semifinals).Louisville would reach the NCAA tournament 23 times in Crum’s 30 seasons, making the Final Four five other times over a span of only 12 seasons at one point. In 1980, the Cardinals survived overtime games in the first two rounds and went on to defeat Crum’s alma mater for the school’s first national championship. They repeated the feat six years later behind the play of seniors Billy Thompson and Milt Wagner and freshman “Never Nervous” Pervis Ellison.“Today is a sad day for me personally, as well as the basketball world,” Louisville Coach Kenny Payne, a freshman on that second national championship team, said Tuesday. “My thoughts go through all the lessons that he taught, not just to me, but every player he ever came in contact with. Those lessons are still relevant today. We were so blessed to have him in our lives. He was a true treasure who gave so much to university and the community. We must keep his memory alive. My prayers go out to his family and especially Susan. He is in a better place. Rest in peace Coach. You touched so many. Well done.”Crum, who twice turned down a chance to coach UCLA in the 1970s (the first time after Wooden’s 1975 retirement), incorporated the lessons he learned from his legendary boss, recruiting the same type of players that had served the Bruins so well and mirroring UCLA’s fast-paced, pressing style of play. There was a simple reason for that.“Because it’s the best,” Crum told The Post in 1983. “It’s been proven that it’s the best. Look at what we’ve done. I like it because it works and it’s what I teach best.”Said Junior Bridgeman, who played for Crum from 1972 to 1975: “He made you prepare for what we did. He said if you are good at what you’re going to do, we’re not going to worry about what the other team is going to do. And that really translates into life. That’s a life lesson that’ll carry you farther and in whatever area you go into.”Crum’s placid sideline demeanor — his nickname was “Cool Hand Luke” — was underscored by a fiery determination to win, and he was not above taking jabs at opponents. In-state rival Kentucky initially refused to play Louisville as Crum elevated the Cardinals into the national conversation, with Joe B. Hall — then the Wildcats’ coach — saying it would be unfair to other in-state schools. In response, Crum suggested that Kentucky would benefit from a revived rivalry if it could “carve into our success” but denied reports that he had named a cow on his farm after the Wildcats coach.In the 1983 NCAA tournament, the two schools met for the first time since 1959, and they resumed their annual rivalry the next season. In retirement, Crum and Hall would co-host a sports-talk radio show for a Louisville station.Denny Crum was truly a Hall of Famer. He was kind, had a great sense of humor but make no mistake about it, he was a competitor who wanted to win every game. My heart goes out to Susan and his family and friends.

      "title": "Analysis | Both parties trust the Weather Channel ... and that’s about it",
      "text": "The good news, such as it is, is that trust in news outlets increased across the board in YouGov’s national polling this year relative to 2022. It’s not entirely clear why: maybe it’s a function of increased trust or maybe it’s something about how the data was collected. But, still, in an era where trust in the media is near a nadir, who are we to rush to dismiss movement in the other direction?Which brings us to the bad news. The media outlet that has the most robustly positive perception among the American public is the one that is most explicitly and structurally apolitical: the Weather Channel. On pretty much everything else, the pattern is heavily saturated with partisanship — like most other things in America.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpAccording to the new data, the Weather Channel is viewed with more trust than distrust by a 53-point margin among Americans. The next most-trusted outlet on net is PBS, which has a 30-point advantage on trustworthiness. But less than half of respondents overall said they found PBS trustworthy or very trustworthy.Partisanship also comes into play with PBS. The Weather Channel is trusted by most Democrats and most Republicans. But PBS is viewed as trustworthy by two-thirds of Democrats and only one-third of Republicans. Why? Oklahoma offers some indications: There, Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) has attacked PBS for “overly sexualiz[ing] or indoctrinat[ing] children” — his office citing the fact that the show “Clifford the Big Red Dog” showed a lesbian couple as evidence of this effect.PBS is tied with ABC News for second as the most-trusted outlet by Democrats. Among Republicans, second-place goes to Fox News, followed by the further-right cable channel Newsmax.There’s a pattern that emerges from the data. Democrats are more likely to express trust in media outlets in general, with the party’s median level of trust at of 46 percent. (In other words, half of the outlets polled by YouGov come in above 46 percent among Democrats and half below.) Among Republicans, trust is lower; the median is 24 percent.If we compare the views of members of the two parties (after adjusting for the extent to which people had any opinion of the outlet), the pattern looks like the chart below. Anything above the diagonal line is an outlet more trusted by Republicans and the further above the line, the bigger the partisan gap. Anything below the line is more trusted by Democrats. (The value for each outlet is located at the center of its name.)You can see that big blob of outlets in the lower right. That reflects the medians expressed above: Democrats view more outlets with trust than Republicans, so those outlets land in that section of the graph.A few outlets are highlighted. Infowars is interesting: a fringe-right purveyor of baseless conspiracy theories, Democrats view it with slightly more trust overall (20 percent to 15 percent) almost certainly because Democrats give nearly everything higher trust scores. If we adjust for how familiar people are with Infowars, the two parties are about equally skeptical.Compare that to One America News, a slightly less egregious purveyor of false information that is more squarely partisan than Infowars. It’s above the diagonal, a bit under the Fox News mark.We can look at the data a different way. We can roughly account for the partisan lean toward media (Democratic trust, Republican distrust) by comparing each outlet’s trustworthiness score to the partisan median. So Fox News is below the median for Democrats and well above the median for Republicans, landing it in the top-left box below.The most interesting outlets are those in the top-right and bottom-left boxes. Those are the outlets which are viewed with above-median trust by both parties or below-median trust, respectively. So we see that the Weather Channel is in the upper-right box (above the diagonal, since it’s further above the Republican median trust score than it is above the higher Democratic median trust score). Infowars is squarely in the lower-right.(The Washington Post, I will note, is also in that upper-right box.)What’s interesting about viewing the values this way is that the partisan nature of the upper-left box becomes apparent. All of its members are explicitly right-wing, and some distance from the diagonal. In the lower-right box are outlets that are often tagged as left-wing, like NPR, or explicitly left-wing, like MSNBC. But (in part because the Democratic median is higher) they remain closer to that diagonal dividing line.The upshot of all of this is what it was at the beginning. Republicans distrust most media and give more trust to explicitly partisan outlets. Democrats trust media more broadly. And everyone can agree that the Weather Channel’s presentations are trustworthy.At least until hurricanes start going woke.",

      "title": "Bob Huggins apologizes for using homophobic slur in radio appearance",
      "text": "West Virginia men’s basketball coach Bob Huggins “deeply” apologized Monday for using a “completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase” in a radio appearance.The university said it does not condone his language and is reviewing the situation.Earlier in the day, during an interview with a Cincinnati radio station, Huggins twice used a homophobic slur. The former University of Cincinnati coach was recalling a years-ago Bearcats matchup with Xavier University in which, he said, Musketeers fans threw “rubber penises on the floor.”After a radio host joked that it was “transgender night” at the arena, another asked Huggins to confirm that the incident occurred in an installment of the “Crosstown Shootout,” Cincinnati’s annual rivalry game against Xavier.“What it was,” Huggins replied, “was all those f--s, those Catholic f--s.”After some laughs but mostly silence for a moment from the radio hosts, the 69-year-old Huggins added, “They were envious they didn’t have one.”In his subsequent statement, shared by West Virginia basketball, Huggins said: “Earlier today on a Cincinnati radio program, I was asked about the rivalry between my former employer, the University of Cincinnati, and its crosstown rival, Xavier University. During the conversation, I used a completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase that there is simply no excuse for — and I won’t try to make one here.“I deeply apologize to the individuals I have offended as well as to the Xavier University community, the University of Cincinnati community, and West Virginia University. As I have shared with my players over my 40 years of coaching, there are consequences for our words and actions, and I will fully accept any coming my way. I am ashamed and embarrassed and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I must do better, and I will.”West Virginia’s athletic department said in a statement that Huggins’s comments were “insensitive, offensive and do not represent our University values.”“West Virginia University does not condone the use of such language and takes such actions very seriously,” it added. “The situation is under review and will be addressed by the University and its athletics department.”pic.twitter.com/TfXSEW7Jh5A native of Morgantown, W.Va., and a former Mountaineers player, Huggins has coached the team for 16 seasons, including a Final Four run in 2010. Before that, he coached Cincinnati for 16 seasons, with one year at Kansas State between the two lengthy stints.Including five years at Akron, where Huggins made his Division I coaching debut, he has amassed a record of 863-389 at college’s highest level. The retirement in March of Syracuse’s Jim Boeheim left Huggins with the most wins among active Division I men’s coaches. He was inducted last year to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.Huggins’s comments Monday reminded many of a scandal involving former Cincinnati Reds announcer Thom Brennaman, who used the same slur on air during a 2020 game telecast. Brennaman, a veteran play-by-play man who had also called NFL and college football games, was suspended and resigned shortly thereafter.As some noted after Huggins’s comments went viral, he had shared a tweet in 2020 thanking Brennaman for coming to Morgantown and speaking with the Mountaineers several weeks after the announcer resigned.“His message isn’t one of excuses but one of accountability,” Huggins wrote of Brennaman then. “It takes courage to confront mistakes head on and I believe our guys learned that from his time with us.”",

      "title": "Analysis | Trump’s affair was huge tabloid news. Now it’s apparently news to him.",
      "text": "Even for a former president known to tell the occasional whopper or 30,000, it’s hard to top this one.Donald Trump’s October 2022 deposition in the E. Jean Carroll case was already notable for something he said about his second wife, Marla Maples. Trump infamously mistook Carroll for Maples in a photo he was shown, despite having suggested that because Carroll was “not my type” he would have had no interest in her. Carroll has accused him of a decades-old rape.But Trump’s ostensible fuzziness about that Maples era of his life apparently extended to elsewhere in the deposition, a transcript and video of which was released Friday.At one point, Carroll’s attorney asked Trump a basic factual question: “Isn’t it true that you were seeing Ms. Maples before you were divorced from Ivana Trump?”Trump responded, amazingly, “I don’t know,” in the sworn deposition. “It was towards the end of the marriage. So I don’t know, really. It could be a lapover, but I don’t really know.”(It is not clear what a “lapover” means, but we’re guessing it refers to overlap.)Trump was also asked more generally if he had been seeing women outside of his first marriage, and he responded, “I don’t know.”So the man who engaged in one of the most famous and widely reported-upon affairs in American history apparently isn’t sure whether the timeline qualifies it as an extramarital affair.That timeline is murky, in large part, because this was mostly tabloid fodder early on. And that provided Trump the plausible deniability he often exploits, while burnishing his playboy credentials. Trump seemed to have fun playing coy, often referring to Maples as just a friend without truly doing the work of denying the story.Trump’s divorce from Ivana was finalized in December 1990. And both before and in the years after, it became clear his relationship with Marla Maples had been more than a rumor.In April 1990, amid the rampant gossip, Trump decided to present Maples to the world at the opening of his Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City.That same month, Maples conducted an interview in which she said she couldn’t comment on the affair rumors because of “pending litigation.” But when asked whether she loved Trump, she responded, “I can’t lie about it. Oh, I do.” Asked about a romantic relationship, she said, “I do love him.”In November that year, Vanity Fair published a broad-ranging feature on Maples. She wore a gold Cartier ring given to her by Trump and said, “I believe I have a purpose and that there is a reason we’re together.” At the time, the question wasn’t whether they had had an affair, but whether it began early enough to complicate a revised prenuptial agreement with Ivana Trump from three years prior.Perhaps the most significant evidence of the timeline came in 1994, when Trump confirmed a long-rumored Christmas 1989 standoff between the women in Aspen, Colo. Ivana Trump had dished about it to ABC News in 1991, and Trump decided to do the same:(The video of that interview, as it happens, re-emerged on the 2016 campaign trail the same day that The Washington Post broke the news about the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump bragged about groping women.)Trump suggested that the confrontation on the slopes forced the issue, whereas “it’s possible that, you know, maybe it would still be going on.”He summarized: “My life was so great in so many ways. The business was so great. … I mean, a beautiful girlfriend, beautiful wife, beautiful everything. I mean, life was just a bowl of cherries.”Apparently that bowl of cherries just isn’t that memorable a quarter-century later. What other explanation could there be?",

But blackouts have fueled concerns about a possible nuclear meltdown.“Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last summer. Nearly a year later, the situation remains dire.Moscow and Kyiv have each blamed the other for the deteriorating conditions at Zaporizhzhia, the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency have been allowed limited access to the site, but the U.N. watchdog has not been able to secure a deal to keep the nuclear materials there safe.IAEA head Rafael Grossi has visited the facility during the war, most recently in March, crossing from Ukrainian to Russian-occupied territory. He urged a focus on protecting the facility, even if fighting in the area could not be stopped entirely.On May 8, Russian authorities said they were preparing to evacuate about 3,100 staff from areas in and around the facility, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear operator said, amid fear that a Ukrainian spring offensive could lead to fighting that would damage the plant.

      "text": "Lionel Messi was expected to resume training with his Paris Saint-Germain teammates Tuesday, and his father denied a report that a “done deal” was in place for the Argentine soccer star to play in Saudi Arabia once his contract with the elite French club expires next month.“There are always rumors and many use the name of Lionel to gain notoriety but there’s only one truth and we can assure you that there is nothing with anyone,” Jorge Messi wrote in an Instagram story in Spanish. “Neither verbal, nor signed, nor agreed, and there won’t be anything until the end of the season.”Lionel Messi was handed a two-week suspension by PSG last week for missing practice while making an unauthorized trip to Saudi Arabia. He apologized to teammates and fans, and the team shortened his suspension but will fine him two weeks’ pay (roughly $1.7 million). Messi trained by himself Monday at PSG’s facility while his teammates had the day off after beating Troyes on Sunday, and he is expected to be available for PSG’s next match Saturday against Ajaccio, according to ESPN. PSG has four matches left on its schedule, which concludes June 3.⚽️🔛 Leo Messi back in training this Monday morning. pic.twitter.com/Neo6GEWEImLater Monday, Messi attended the Laureus World Sports Awards in Paris. He was named sportsman of the year and accepted the world team of the year award on behalf of Argentina, which he led to the World Cup championship in December. Meanwhile, the Agence France-Presse reported that the superstar will leave PSG when his contract is up June 30.“Messi is a done deal. He will play in Saudi Arabia next season,” the AFP reported, citing a person with knowledge of the deal who it said spoke on the condition of anonymity and chose not to name the Saudi club. “The contract is exceptional. It’s huge. We are just finalizing some small details.”PSG said only that Messi remains under contract until the end of next month, and an unnamed person close to the club told ESPN: “If the club had wanted to renew his contract, it would have been done earlier.”Messi joined PSG in 2021 after spending the previous 17 years with Barcelona’s first team, winning 10 La Liga and four UEFA Champions League titles. There has been speculation that he might prefer to return to Barcelona, but Jorge Messi wrote there is “absolutely no agreement with any club for next season. The decision won’t be taken prior to Lionel finish[ing] the season with PSG. We will assess the situation at the end of the season.”Were he to go to Saudi Arabia, Messi, who turns 36 next month, would be following his rival Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League this winter in a roughly $439 million deal that made him the world’s highest-paid athlete, according to recent data from Forbes. Ronaldo’s deal and the reported deal for Messi, according to the AFP, are bankrolled through the Public Investment Fund, one of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds with more than $620 billion in assets.“The negotiations didn’t take as much time as the ones with Ronaldo, as we now know the recipe to contract world-class players,” the unnamed person told the AFP. “It’s Saudi Arabia that brought him, not a specific club. The money comes from one place — PIF.”Ronaldo’s tenure at Al Nassr has not gone smoothly. The team is out of contention in the King Cup and Super Cup, and there have been reports that an unhappy Ronaldo, at 38, may be hoping to engineer a return to Real Madrid, where he played from 2009 to 2018.",

      "title": "Joey Meneses does the damage as Nats’ ninth-inning rally is enough this time",
      "text": "PHOENIX — On Saturday night, the Washington Nationals had a golden opportunity to steal a game they had no business winning, only to blow it in heartbreaking fashion. So forgive them for not pouring out of the Chase Field dugout after Joey Meneses hit a go-ahead, three-run homer in the ninth inning Sunday.Sure, the Nationals yelled from the dugout and raised their hands in jubilation. But they had learned the hard way the night before that you can’t celebrate until all 27 outs are in the books.This time, they closed the deal. Hunter Harvey got the call and got the save as Washington squeaked out a 9-8 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks to avoid a three-game sweep.“These guys got a bunch of heart, and they’re playing together,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “They feel like they’re never out of it, and today’s another good example.”The Nationals (14-20) headed west for this six-game trip to Phoenix and San Francisco riding the high of winning a series against the Chicago Cubs. They outplayed the Cubs and, more importantly, played some of their best — and cleanest — baseball of the season.But so much can change from one series to the next. And for most of Sunday afternoon, it appeared the Nationals would get swept because of mental mistakes that Martinez had wanted his team to avoid. Washington walked 11 batters and failed to handle many of the small details.“We got to start pitching a little better again,” Martinez said. “... The walks are killing us. We got to start throwing strikes again and keep giving ourselves a chance, try not to make these games so interesting.”Nationals’ Stone Garrett, back in Arizona, remembers his big league shotIn the second inning, Alex Call singled with Meneses on third and Dominic Smith on second. Meneses scored easily, and, given the slow grounder up the middle, it seemed Smith should have had no problem scoring, too. But Smith was held at third, a decision that proved costly when he was thrown out two batters later on a CJ Abrams flyball.The Nationals led 1-0 until Trevor Williams allowed a solo shot to Lourdes Gurriel Jr. in the bottom half. Two innings later, he gave up a solo shot to Christian Walker. Williams balked with runners on second and third later in the fourth, allowing another run to score.Washington scored twice in the fifth to tie it at 3, only to give the lead right back to the Diamondbacks (19-15). Williams walked the leadoff man, then allowed a triple on a ball that bounced off right fielder Lane Thomas’s glove when he leaped near the warning track.Williams retired the next batter, then was replaced by Andrés Machado. He walked Pavin Smith with two outs, then threw a sinker that Gurriel smashed for his second homer of the game and his third in the past two. (He had the game-tying homer in the ninth inning Saturday.) This three-run shot made it 7-3.Hobie Harris, who entered in the sixth, walked three batters, and the Diamondbacks stole three bases with him on the mound but didn’t score.But the Nationals, as they did all weekend, showed an ability to battle back. They scored twice in the seventh to cut their deficit to 7-5 — but then Thaddeus Ward walked four batters, including the first three he faced, as he threw just eight of his 24 pitches for strikes and allowed a run.The Nationals remained persistent. They added a run in the eighth, then got back-to-back hits by Luis García and Keibert Ruiz before Meneses’s ninth-inning blast, his second homer of the season.“It seems like, unfortunately, I haven’t had the big hits like I did last season,” Meneses said through an interpreter. “But just keep working, keep battling, and hopefully my confidence keeps going.”Harvey, who got the call after Kyle Finnegan struggled Saturday night, notched the first save of his career. He said after the game it was difficult to keep his adrenaline under control; he and his dad, Bryan, became the ninth father-son duo to record saves in the majors.And when the bottom half concluded, the Nationals formed a line in front of their dugout for the first time this weekend. They could finally relax. They could finally celebrate.Here’s what else to know about the Nationals’ win:Martinez said after the game that center fielder Victor Robles, who was held out of the lineup after he injured his back sliding into second base Saturday, was suffering from back spasms and would go on the injured list. Jake Alu will be recalled from Class AAA Rochester to take his roster spot.Third baseman Jeimer Candelario, who was taken to the hospital following Friday night’s game after experiencing dehydration, said Sunday he felt good. He said he started to feel unwell in the eighth inning, but then he felt “weird” after he showered postgame. He was released from the hospital Saturday but didn’t play Sunday; Ildemaro Vargas started in his place.The Nationals ended Carter Kieboom’s rehab assignment at Class AA Harrisburg, reinstating him from the injured list and sending him to Rochester. The 25-year-old third baseman missed all of last season because of Tommy John surgery, then had his start to this season delayed by a right shoulder impingement.Candelario started the first 32 games at third base and, barring an injury, is likely to continue to be the Nationals’ everyday third baseman even when Kieboom returns.",

      "title": "A year after journalist’s killing, report finds pattern of Israeli inaction",
      "text": "JERUSALEM — A year after Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead during an Israeli army raid in the West Bank, likely by an Israeli soldier, no one has been charged, disciplined or otherwise held responsible.And no one is likely to be, according to a new analysis of the killings of journalists covering Israel and the West Bank over the past two decades. Despite the international uproar it provoked, Abu Akleh’s slaying has settled into a case study of Israel’s ability to sidestep accountability.The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists focused on the cases of 20 reporters whose deaths it attributed to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since 2001. The group found systemic similarities in Israel’s response, including the most fundamental one: No one has been charged or held accountable in any of them.The report said Israel responded to the incidents with variations on a standard playbook, including preemptive denials of responsibility, discounting contrary evidence and witness testimony, and opaque internal investigations that never led to charges — even when it did produce statements of possible culpability, as happened in the case of Abu Akleh, a veteran Al Jazeera correspondent.“The killing of Shireen Abu Akleh illustrated everything that is wrong with this process,” said Robert Mahoney, CPJ’s director of special projects and one of the report’s editors. “Starting with misleading or false narratives put out immediately that were slowly walked back until we reached the point five months later when the results of the IDF’s internal probe said there was a high probability that IDF forces accidentally shot Shireen.”Massive crowds, police beatings as journalist’s funeral is held in JerusalemNeither the Israeli foreign minister nor the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would comment on the report. The IDF declined to respond to its specifics, but provided a lengthy statement saying it did not “target noncombatants” and defending its investigation of the deaths as legal and certified by “several Supreme Court rulings.”“The IDF regrets any harm to civilians during operational activity and considers the protection of the freedom of the press and the professional work of journalists to be of great importance,” the statement said.The report’s authors looked at more than two dozen cases of journalists killed while reporting in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in recent decades, reviewing press coverage and interviewing witnesses and families. They eliminated those clearly killed by Palestinian gunmen or explosive devises, focusing on deaths attributable to IDF fire.Even if the killings were not intentional — as the IDF has said in the case of Abu Akleh — the military still has an obligation to safeguard reporters, who are considered civilians and noncombatants under international law. Most of the reporters killed — at least 13, according to the report — were clearly identifiable as journalists.A Reuters camera operator, Fadel Shana, was wearing standard blue body armor marked “PRESS” and standing beside a car marked “TV” when he was struck by an Israeli tank projectile in Gaza in 2008, according to an account in the report.Abu Akleh and her experienced crew were attired in the same sort of marked protective gear when they were fired on. The surviving crew members told The Washington Post they been making an effort, as always, to remain away from danger and make themselves obvious and unthreatening to the IDF forces in sight.“Whatever the Israeli army says for us to do, we do,” longtime producer Ali al-Samudi said in May 2022 in an interview from the hospital bed where he was recovering from a shoulder wound hours after the incident, his own bloodstained press vest on the table beside him.The team had entered Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian militant activity and a frequent site of IDF incursions, on May 11 of last year after reports of Israeli soldiers conducting a raid. They arrived after the hottest action had concluded and positioned themselves well away from the blocks where fighting had flared.They came under a sudden burst of fire, according to video and multiple witness accounts. Abu Akleh was fatally shot in the head.The Israeli response that followed comported largely with the pattern described by the CPJ report.Israeli officials immediately released various statements asserting that Abu Akleh “most likely” was hit by a Palestinian gunman during crossfire, despite firsthand witness accounts that there was no firefight in the area at the time.Over the following four months, Israel’s position shifted as evidence mounted contradicting its initial claims. In September — after a ballistic analysis by the United States and video forensic reviews by multiple news organizations, including The Washington Post — the IDF acknowledged there was a “high probability” that the bullet was mistakenly fired by one of its soldiers.The army declined to make public the evidence of its review and said at the time that no one would be punished for the shooting.Critics say Israel’s repeated lack of transparency in the investigations, and its failure to hold anyone responsible, have fed international skepticism about the country’s commitment to protecting journalists.“If there were proper investigations of these incidents, it would clear up a lot of the doubts,” Mahoney said. “Shireen’s case is a perfect example of that.”All but two of the 20 journalists whose fatalities are reviewed in the report were Palestinian. Even more than foreign reporters — who come with the backing of international news organizations and, implicitly, their national embassies — local reporters often work without support in a hostile and unpredictable environment.Many say conditions are worse than ever, even those who covered the bloodiest periods of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ahmad Mashal, a Jerusalem-based freelance producer for almost 30 years, said it used to be Israeli officers who would ask journalists to shift position or stop filming, explaining their reasons for interfering in reporting and often showing their legal authority for doing so. Now, soldiers of all ages, as well as armed settlers, feel empowered to harass or threaten journalists without pretense, he said.“What’s scary now is that you can be killed for no reason. I mean no reason,” Mashal said. “The army, the police, the settlers, they all have a green light to do whatever they want. I’m scared to even put my hand in my pocket at a checkpoint.”",

      "text": "Is Kendall Roy a fashion icon?The idea that the weak-willed scion of “Succession” is a figure whose wardrobe is worthy of emulation is an amusing realization to Michelle Matland, the costume designer for the HBO drama that tracks corporate and familial ladder-climbing of the fictional Roy dynasty. After all, Kendall’s fashion choices — like a pair of pricey Lanvin sneakers purchased to impress the founders of an art start-up or the enormous Rashid Johnson pendant he dons like a talisman of virtue signaling — are used to relay his cluelessness and insecurities.“These are costumes, not fashion,” says Matland. “And so it’s very interesting that they become fashion.”In other words, Kendall’s clothes are not meant to be aspirational, but rather tell us how desperately he’s trying to belong. But somehow, his expensive bomber jackets and cashmere baseball caps have made him into the face of America’s biggest fashion trend: the “quiet luxury” movement.Across TikTok, creators opine that the luxury logomania that thrived over the past several years — putting a Balenciaga logo hoodie over a Supreme T-shirt and Gucci-print sweatpants — is hardly the uniform of the one percent.“This is not luxury fashion — that’s a billboard,” says creator Jansen Garside in a video from late March. Instead, he says, the wealthy buy “quiet luxury, where the luxury aspect comes in the form of incredibly high-quality materials, construction, and reputation.” As another user, sherhymeswithorange, described the look, “‘I’m so rich, I don’t even need to tell you how rich I am’— otherwise known as quiet luxury.”Instead of Gucci and Balenciaga, creators direct viewers to the Italian brands Brunello Cucinelli, whose T-shirts and tailoring are beloved by Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, and Loro Piana, whose Gift of Kings fabric, which is visually indistinguishable from your average wool but promises an “infinite lightness” that is softer to the touch than cashmere, is cut into T-shirts and sweaters that sell for upward of $2,000.Matland says that in researching the show’s costumes, she and her team followed one percenters into stores like Brunello and Loro, “and we would literally kind of mimic what they were touching, feeling. And it is so much textural.” The appeal of clothing to this kind of person, Matland says, is “just in the fabrication of the garment. And obviously, certain cuts are going to be minimalist and refined just based on the styling.”Though quiet luxury (and its siblings, “stealth wealth” and the “old money aesthetic”) have been topics of conversation on social media for almost two years now, the idea has become even more discussed since the premiere of “Succession’s” fourth and final season. A number of creators demonstrate how they get the quiet luxury look — “people with quiet luxury wear tailored pieces often in monochromatic tones,” explained Liz Teich, a.k.a. thenewyorkstylist, in a quiet-luxury explainer that’s been viewed on TikTok more than half a million times as she loops a black leather belt into a pair of cream high-waisted trousers and throws on a tobacco-colored blazer — to a soundtrack of the show’s opening theme. A number of these videos are hashtagged “successioncore.”The idea was further popularized by Gwyneth Paltrow’s ensembles throughout her highly watched ski trial, when she arrived in court wearing subdued blue Prada blouses and skirts, and oversize coats by the Row. Vogue, the New York Post, Time Magazine and the Daily Mail have all written recent guides to quiet luxury, extolling the virtues of starkly plain $1,390 Tom Ford hoodies and $625 Loro Piana cashmere-blend baseball caps.“Succession’s” latest season even provided its own allegory on the quiet luxury versus logo-crazy dynamic in its opening episode, when Greg’s date, an arriviste named Bridget, attends Logan Roy’s birthday party with what Tom Wambsgans deems “a ludicrously capacious bag” in a screeching Burberry plaid that, in the Roys’ world, telegraphs the item’s cost and therefore, her poor taste.The idea that the American elite embrace a way of dressing that is coded, designed to be understood by only their fellow one percenters, is nothing new. If the American Dream means that anyone, theoretically, can aspire to expensive clothes, how do the truly rich signal their status? Counterintuitively, by wearing understated or even worn-down clothing.Edith Wharton’s books carefully chronicle the ways that upper-crust Manhattanites at the turn of the 20th century dressed to ensure their look was inaccessible to anyone who merely had money, refusing to wear new clothes until they were a few years old. (In fact, streetwear fanatics often treat their new Supreme merchandise the same way, “putting it on ice” until the hype has mellowed.)Maggie Bullock, author of the new J. Crew history “Kingdom of Prep,” describes how students at Ivy League universities in the early- and mid-20th century — the era from which J. Crew took inspiration — would wear their most-worn-in clothes as a point of pride. “It was all about how slouchy it was, and how broken-in it was, and you didn’t want it to look new, and you didn’t want to look like you tried too hard,” she says. “They could afford to dress that way because it wasn’t going to knock them off their social platform or their rung of the ladder. They could afford to almost flagrantly play with their presentation.” Someone who wasn’t White or rich, in other words, had to look “presentable” or had to “try”— a classist reality that is also percolating in the quiet luxury discourse.Emily Cinader, the daughter of J. Crew’s founder who would lead the company through its first golden period, in the 1990s, had such an understated sense of style that employees well-versed in the vibrant pouf skirts of Christian Lacroix and the pastel, pony-embroidered polos of Ralph Lauren thought she was badly dressed: “They thought that Emily was a super boring dresser,” Bullock says. “Like, there’s nothing to this.” Perennially makeup-free, she favored white button-downs, gray trousers, and chunky loafers — quiet luxury, in other words — and colleagues were even encouraged to remove any bracelets before entering her workspace so that they didn’t clang in distraction. (Sounds like material for a Roy family eccentricity!) That period, unsurprisingly, is newly trendy for its minimalist and unfussy classics, which is now lionized by fashion fans and Instagram accounts like @lostjcrew and @simplicitycity.And unpacking those codes, as creators are now obsessively doing on social media and editors in magazine pages, is almost an American rite of passage. Podcaster Avery Trufelman recently dove into the anthropological obsessions with class and “American style” on the latest season of her show “Articles of Interest,” tracking how in the 1960s, Japanese retailers came to Ivy League campuses to capture the frayed chinos and sun-bleached rugbys worn by students, and created the book “Take Ivy,” which has since its 1965 publication become a permanent fixture on American menswear designers’ mood boards. Similarly, Lisa Birnbach’s “The Official Preppy Handbook,” first released in 1980 and now considered a cult classic that sells for upward of $300, broke down the habits of dynastic WASPs decades before “old money TikTok” was a thing. Intended as satire, the book accidentally became a manual for those outside WASP inner circles to learn about boarding schools and the art of layering L.L. Bean pullovers. Perhaps it’s a way to insist that, no matter how complicated or arcane the sartorial codes of the rich get, they can and will be made accessible to all. “The really American thing about this,” says Trufelman, “is the potential attainability of it.”Or perhaps the difficult truth is that we all just want to look rich, or at least know what they look like. Income disparity may be at a historic high, but it feels as though the wealthy are less visible than ever. Other than the dysfunctional family we see on television every Sunday night, the one percent is almost out of view, especially for those who have spent the past few years learning about clothing (and status) through social media.There is also a sense of shock that the name brands we know well, and which have been marketed to us as signals of success, are not. Instead, a vast conspiracy of secret brands we’ve never heard of is being worn by countless billionaires. In fact, the brands often name-checked in these videos — Brunello, Loro, Akris, Khaite — barely qualify as elite for people with an extreme amount of money.Tiina the Store, in the Hamptons enclave Amagansett, has become something of a refuge for one percenters who are horrified by the obvious excesses of neighbors who have a more showy relationship to their wealth. “I’m sure you know what’s happening in East Hampton,” says Tiina Laakkonen, who founded the store in 2012, referring to the appearance of Gucci and Prada on the town’s main commercial drag. “Maybe at one point in their lives, Hermes meant something to them, but I think today, they are not interested in that world. It’s almost like, it’s a little nouveau riche for them.”Their husbands may still gravitate to Loro and Brunello, but her women customers wear what she refers to as “a parallel universe of brands,” like the Arts&Science, a Japanese brand of workwear-inspired, soft tailoring; Casey Casey, a Paris-based line of simple cotton skirts and blouses; and Wommelsdorff, a collection of hand-knit, almost naive sweaters that cost up to $2,450.“The idea that you are wearing something that nobody else knows exactly what it is [or] where you got it — they like [that],” Laakkonen says. “They like the idea that, I’m the only one who has this.” What they look for, Laakkonen says, is “uniqueness, and that feeling when it looks kind of like nothing and [it’s] simple, but you know it is the most beautifully made, in the most beautiful material.”These are the kinds of brands that Jeremy Strong, the actor who plays Kendall Roy, often mixes into the wardrobe of his character as he collaborates with Matland — brands like Geoffrey B. Small and Haans Nicholsa Mott, who make what’s often called “slow fashion” for its seasonless, trend-averse appeal. Kendall, at least in terms of his wardrobe, is right on the money.But why does this obsession with the wardrobes of the wealthy persist? “Because we’re interested in anything we can’t have,” Matland says. “I would love to have a million bucks too.” She laughs. “I think we inherently always want to reach a little higher than where we are, just by nature of being human. It’s not a negative. We always want whatever is just unobtainable.”If Matland had a million dollars, would she dress like a “Succession” character? Without missing a beat, she answers: “No.”",

      "title": "China and Canada expel each other’s diplomats over interference claims",
      "text": "TORONTO — Beijing on Tuesday ordered a Canadian diplomat to leave China, in a swift retaliatory move after Ottawa expelled a Chinese diplomat who allegedly had targeted a Canadian lawmaker.The moves threaten to further inflame ties between Ottawa and Beijing, which were locked in a diplomatic dispute for three years over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Mélanie Joly, Canada’s foreign minister, on Monday said she was expelling Zhao Wei, a Chinese diplomat based in Toronto.Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail reported last week that the diplomat was involved in a campaign to punish Michael Chong, a Conservative lawmaker, and his family in Hong Kong because of his support for a parliamentary motion that called China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority a “genocide.”“I have been clear: We will not tolerate any form of foreign interference in our internal affairs,” Joly said in a statement announcing the Canadian government’s decision.China’s Foreign Ministry responded with a formal diplomatic protest and asked Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, a diplomat at the Canadian Consulate in Shanghai, to leave the country before May 13.“China strongly condemns and firmly opposes” Canada’s move and reserves the right to take further action, it said in a statement.China did not give a reason for its choice of Lalonde.Lalonde has in recent months played a prominent role in Canada’s public diplomacy in Shanghai, attending a literary event on Canadian writer Alice Munro, visiting a rural education nonprofit and speaking at an international women’s film festival screening, according to reports in Chinese media.Trudeau orders probe of alleged Chinese interference in Canadian electionPrime Minister Justin Trudeau had faced calls to expel Zhao.The Globe and Mail reported that a 2021 document from Canada’s spy agency said an officer with the Chinese Ministry of State Security had sought information on a Canadian lawmaker’s relatives “who may be located in the [People’s Republic of China], for further potential sanctions.”The top-secret report said the aim of the effort was “almost certainly … to make an example of this MP and deter others from taking anti-PRC positions.”An unnamed national security source told the newspaper Chong was the lawmaker and Zhao was the Chinese officer involved in the effort.Chong on Monday said that it shouldn’t have taken so long for the government to boot Zhao.“We have known for years that the PRC is using its accredited diplomats here in Canada to target Canadians and their families,” he told reporters in Ottawa, adding, “This should have happened years ago.”Trudeau has maintained that he learned of the effort to intimidate Chong from the Globe and Mail story. He said last week that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) hadn’t shared the report outside of the agency because it wasn’t a “significant enough concern.”Chong told Parliament that he was advised by Trudeau’s national security and intelligence adviser that CSIS had shared the report with her predecessor and “relevant departments,” but not with the prime minister.Trudeau said he would compel the spy agency to share such information with him in the future.“Moving forward, any threat — whether it’s serious or credible or not — to a member of Parliament, or their family, particularly from foreign sources, needs to be elevated to higher levels than it was,” he told reporters last week.Details of the alleged threats against Chong and his relatives follow recent stories in local media about apparent efforts by China to interfere in Canadian affairs, including the 2021 federal election.The reports, citing leaked intelligence documents, allege that China wanted to ensure that Trudeau’s Liberals were reelected with a minority government — an outcome that analysts have said would be difficult to orchestrate.Angry over campus speech by Uighur activist, Chinese students in Canada contact their consulate, film presentationThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police is investigating the source of the leaks.Canadian intelligence agencies have long said China is one of many countries seeking to interfere in Canadian elections. A panel of civil servants reported this year that there was no evidence that the results of the past two federal elections were affected by foreign interference.Trudeau, who came to power pledging closer ties with China, has been under pressure to take a more aggressive stance against Beijing. He has tasked a “special rapporteur” with advising him later this month whether a public inquiry into the alleged Chinese interference is necessary.Ties between Canada and China plunged into a deep freeze in 2018 after China detained two Canadians — former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — in apparent retaliation for Canada’s detention of Meng, the Huawei executive who was wanted in the United States on fraud charges.Meng returned to China in 2021 after she reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors. She was under house arrest in one of her two mansions in Vancouver. Hours later, the “two Michaels,” as they were known in Canada, were on their way home, too.Kovrig and Spavor had been held in separate Chinese prisons on vague charges of espionage and stealing state secrets, allegations for which China never provided evidence. They were tried in secret trials and permitted only a handful of calls with their families during their years-long detentions.Shepherd reported from Taipei, Taiwan.",

      "title": "Perspective | The odyssey of Hunter Dickinson, sponsored by college sports lunacy",
      "text": "Watch closely as Hunter Dickinson announces his next college destination during a quick and disjointed promotional clip. He seems to be pulling double duty: future Kansas Jayhawk and everyday pitchman.Divided into three acts, the video shows Dickinson shooting jumpers by himself in a Northern Virginia basketball training facility that proudly claims him as a client. Next he explains how difficult the lengthy process has been, just as the camera makes the curious choice to zoom in on the steering wheel of the silver Ford Bronco he’s driving.pic.twitter.com/nDiA50wjJgFinally, as Dickinson walks into a hotel ballroom to inform Kansas Coach Bill Self of the good news, the action slows to capture the Jumpman logo on Dickinson’s Jordans. You half-expect Self to turn toward the camera in a Dickinson T-shirt while holding a Bloomin’ Onion. Lucky for us, Self holds on to his dignity.Perhaps the video wasn’t just a shameless exercise in product placement. And Dickinson, 22, may not be a brand ambassador for everything featured in the video he released Thursday morning. Yet the way Dickinson chose to punctuate the end of his extended tour in the NCAA transfer portal gave an unvarnished glimpse at the life of a superstar in college sports.Hunter Dickinson will play at Kansas (college basketball transfer tracker)They are not simply college kids. They have corporate responsibilities. And Dickinson, an all-Big Ten player who averaged 18.5 points with Michigan this past season, can’t just tell us his next destination. As an athlete bound by lucrative contracts, he has to sell us on it, too.His decision to take his talents to Lawrence, Kan., mirrors another highly covered spectacle done years ago by LeBron James. There’s little difference anymore between a free agent and a rising senior. They have earned the power to demand higher platforms and bigger paydays — and to back out like quarterback Jaden Rashada did from his commitment to Florida because a $13 million NIL deal didn’t come through.But as these teens and 20-somethings finally cash in, it’s easy to forget they’re not professionals who are adept at managing their brands — and managing the stress that comes with them.While Dickinson’s search for a new college team dragged on, he continued to update his status while making paid appearances on his Barstool podcast. This week, Dickinson said he was “struggling” to pick a program where he most felt comfortable. He spoke with a similar unease last fall, before the start of the season at Michigan, where he cut deals with a custom T-shirt line and Outback Steakhouse, among others.“It’s probably added a lot of stress. It’s like a whole other aspect to your life that you have to deal with now, like companies contacting you, ask for contracts, and you have other things you have to do for these contracts,” Dickinson told reporters, according to MLive. “There is some added stress to NIL, but I really like it because it provides you with a little bit more money in your pocket.”Young athletes making money isn’t new. Tennis players can turn pro and become millionaires before they can vote; the teen gymnasts we root on every four years return to lucrative marketing deals. But young athletes who have been trained in team sports are only just now experiencing the free market through college recruiting, a world that has long felt to fans like taking a swim inside a gold-plated toilet. It’s dirty and makes you feel icky, and if you spend too much time in its most unpleasant parts — waiting for and hounding mostly underage amateurs for a decision — you might emerge from this cesspool with pinworms. The filth will be worth it, however, if that 7-foot-1 recruit picks your favorite school.That recruiting world has evolved into a Thunderdome free-for-all with the twin sea changes, both of them long overdue, of loosened transfer rules and money from name, image and likeness deals. When Angel Reese transferred from Maryland to LSU, she found more opportunities for NIL sponsorships. Her popularity blossomed even more throughout the season, and by the time LSU reached the Final Four, Reese not only had Virginia Tech and Iowa to scout, she had companies to endorse — and the corresponding stress that comes with it.“It’s been a lot. I kind of set myself to only post on certain days,” Reese said last month about her NIL responsibilities. “So just trying to have a schedule of everything going on because social media has taken over. NIL is just what the game has come to. It is hard and stressful, but the lady I work with, Janine, she has been amazing and has helped me with a lot of this stuff. So shout out to her, but it’s hard. It’s hard.”Since she made that statement, Reese added a Mercedes-Benz dealership as a sponsor. It’s easy to rejoice as she accumulates more fame and wealth, but it’s hard to overlook Reese’s admission that it is difficult to manage her responsibilities.“In my off time, it’s not much off time,” Reese also said during the Final Four. “I’m always doing something that has to do with business.”Business she has the right to participate in, no doubt. But if college stars such as Reese and Dickinson, who on the surface appear comfortable and confident in their newfound fame, can admit to feeling the pressure of maintaining their brands, it makes you wonder: How are their lesser-known peers coping with the pressure? The system has opened the door for NIL, throwing money at an old problem, but is it also creating new ones in the lives of college athletes? And wouldn’t this all work better if the NCAA stepped in and supported the athletes — and regulated the system — by paying them?Dickinson finally found a new home to play basketball — and possibly a better market to make more NIL money. While such deals have ended some of the inequity in college sports, it’s hardly a resolution. The money flows in, and so does the additional pressure.",

      "title": "China raids another global business consultancy, cites spying concerns",
      "text": "Chinese authorities have conducted raids on the offices of Capvision, an international consultancy, to investigate alleged national security risks, intensifying fears that China’s foreign business community is being caught up in an espionage crackdown.The Chinese spy agency and market regulators “recently” launched a joint investigation into the actions of Capvision, conducting simultaneous raids in Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou and Shenzhen, state media reported.The firm, which is headquartered in New York and Shanghai, conducts market intelligence research and connects clients to experts.The first government confirmation of a national-security-linked probe comes after a string of law enforcement investigations targeting foreign consultancies and research firms that have spooked China’s international business community.Police went to the Beijing offices of the Mintz Group, an American firm that conducts corporate due diligence, in March, arresting five employees. Last month, Bain & Company said Chinese authorities had come to its Shanghai offices.Until now, Chinese officials have uttered only vague and brief statements about the need for foreign businesses to “act in accordance with Chinese law.”But the announcement late Monday about Capvision directly tied the probe to counterespionage and national security campaigns that have intensified and expanded under Xi Jinping, China’s powerful leader.In a 15-minute feature on the Capvision investigation, state broadcaster China Central Television accused the firm of offering kickbacks for providing classified information and failing to go through necessary compliance processes before sharing sensitive information to international clients.The announcement came the same day that Qin Gang, China’s foreign minister, told the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, that the two sides should stabilize relations to avoid a “downward spiral.”China’s use of exit bans on the rise, worrying international businessesCCTV accused “some consultancies and investigation firms” of “ignoring possible national security risks and not earnestly fulfilling their responsibilities and obligations to carry out anti-espionage security prevention.”In language that will further unnerve foreign businesses, the program called out Capvision’s practice of connecting its clients to “consulting experts” inside Chinese Communist Party agencies and “work units that touch on state secrets” to obtain sensitive information.The firm “has no relevant management requirements and compliance audits for maintaining national security responsibilities and preventing security risks,” an unnamed Shanghai state security officer told the program. “In fact, no one [at Capvision] cares; they only pursue economic interests.”Capvision, which was founded in 2006 by former Bain and Morgan Stanley employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.However, shortly after Chinese state media reported on the raids, Capvision’s account on WeChat, China’s dominant social media platform, reposted an advertisement for China’s official state security education day on April 15, in an apparent attempt at damage control. The ad said that “the national interest comes above all else.”In reposting the ad, Capvision did not directly comment on the probe but said the company would “resolutely and thoroughly implement the national security and development outlook,” a reference to Xi’s philosophy on the need to build “holistic” defenses against threats to China’s “rejuvenation.”The need to comply with state-secret-related rules is not new for foreign businesses, said James Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of Perkins Coie LLP and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.But because China-U.S. relations have “pretty much bottomed out,” the American business community is “bound to see an uptick in highly politicized enforcement activities,” he said.“Given the fact that there is no effective judicial oversight or remedies, we can also anticipate much overreaching by the police and state security authorities,” Zimmerman said. “A troubling trend indeed.”China says relations with U.S. must be stabilized, avoid ‘downward spiral’Even before recent raids, wave after wave of crackdowns on an array of sectors including online education and ride-hailing — as well as sporadic “zero covid” lockdowns and a bitter trade dispute with the United States — had undermined international investor confidence in being able to navigate the fast-changing political landscape of Xi’s China.A drumbeat of ominous reminders of the political risks of operating in China has worsened those fears in recent months, even as Beijing has repeatedly promised that the country is open for business.A report by a rights group published last week detailed how Chinese authorities have expanded the use of exit bans targeting human rights activists and foreign business people alike, increasingly deploying them in politically charged cases as well as purely commercial legal disputes.That same week, Chinese lawmakers revised an anti-espionage law to insert vague language warning that attempts to acquire “documents, data, materials or items related to national security and interests” could be defined as spying.The legislation also highlighted attempts to “incite, entice, coerce or buy over” state employees as potential acts of espionage.Vic Chiang and Pei-Lin Wu contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Perspective | The Commanders name was a mistake. Josh Harris should change it.",
      "text": "When Josh Harris finally takes ownership of Washington’s NFL team, there will be plenty to do.Harris, the team’s presumed new owner, and the people around him will face countless decisions, starting with figuring out a new stadium deal — something Daniel Snyder couldn’t do, because he became toxic to just about anyone and everyone with whom he had contact.That debate will go on for a while, although ultimately, if Harris knows what he’s doing, the new stadium will be built on the site of RFK Stadium.There will be lots of other decisions to be made. Will Coach Ron Rivera and his staff return in 2024? Who should be in the front office? What sort of media deals should the team make locally?As stadium competition looms, Commanders lobby Congress over future of RFKThose are choices that shouldn’t be rushed. Harris’s people almost certainly will need the coming season before making any major changes in the football team and its leadership, both on and off the field.But there is one decision Harris can make the day he takes over, amid the celebratory fanfare of his “I’m not Dan Snyder” introductory news conference.Change the team’s name. Yes, again.“Commanders” will be one of Snyder’s lasting legacies — unless the name is changed again and ASAP.Snyder was dragged kicking and screaming into changing the name, a process that began in 2020. In 2013, he famously told USA Today: “We’ll never change the name. It’s that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.”He forgot to add, “Unless my key corporate partners threaten to pull financial support.”That’s why the team changed its name in 2020 — first to Washington Football Team and then, after what was supposedly an exhaustive search, to Commanders.A lot of people — myself included — thought sticking with Washington Football Team would be fine. It was, if nothing else, different. Commanders was an absolute yawn from Day 1, even with all the hype and fanfare the team desperately tried to create.That’s the second reason to change the name again — the first being to put Snyder’s disastrous 24-year stewardship as far in the rearview mirror as possible.Yes, a third name change in less than five years would be complicated and expensive. It would mean petitioning for the NFL’s approval, but who among the other owners and Commissioner Roger Goodell wouldn’t want to put Snyder’s legacy behind them?A question that is tangential to this column but needs to be asked: Will the NFL’s investigation of Snyder ever reach a conclusion? Will the results be released publicly, as promised? Or will the NFL just bury all of Snyder’s wrongdoing in the joy over his departure and try to pretend he never existed? Snyder? Never heard of him.Okay, fine: Then let’s pretend the Commanders never existed, either. I wouldn’t mind if they went back to Washington Football Team, but that probably wouldn’t make those in charge of selling logoed gear very happy. Maybe just shorten it to “Washington Footballers?”Not likely.Barry Svrluga: Josh Harris’s biggest strength? He isn’t Dan Snyder.So let’s play an old game and come up with a name that has something to do with D.C., which is where we all hope the team will end up when the lease on the godforsaken stadium formerly named for Jack Kent Cooke is finally over in 2027.The most obvious D.C. names — Capitals and Nationals — are taken. Senators is still a name connected to failed baseball teams and probably doesn’t belong on a football team’s jersey.Abe Pollin had good intentions when he decided to rename the Bullets, but how in the world anyone landed on Wizards is impossible to guess. It is a name that has no connection to Washington.And yet 25 years later, the Wizards are still the Wizards, with no end or change in sight. Maybe they should go back to the team’s original name — Zephyrs, from their days in Chicago. One definition of a zephyr is “a soft gentle breeze.” What’s wrong with that?Back to football. For a long time, I thought a team located in Washington should have a name connected to the Supreme Court since the court is a couple of blocks from the Capitol, is one of the most important institutions in our country and was allegedly above smarmy politics. I liked “Washington Justice” or “Washington Supremes.”Now, though, the court has become so political — regardless of which side of the aisle you occupy — that it’s a bad idea. Of course, bad ideas have become the bedrock of sports in this area, but there’s no need to add another one.How about “Washington Monuments?” Other than the White House, that monument is easily the most recognized landmark in a city full of them. Everyone knows exactly what it is, and it literally towers over the D.C. landscape. It is completely apolitical, the backdrop for so many civic events.It’s certainly far more about Washington than Commanders — which has as much to do with Washington as Penguins with Pittsburgh or Jazz with Salt Lake City.There’s no doubt that Harris will have about a thousand issues on his plate seemingly more important than the team’s name. But this is something he could announce right away during his honeymoon period as the team’s owner, even with the understanding that change wouldn’t be quick or easy.The sooner we can all pretend that Snyder’s ownership of the team was just a bad dream — okay, a nightmare — the better.",

Super Bowl LVIII is Feb. 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.NFL draft grades: Texans, Eagles, Seahawks are at the head of the classWe know who and where each team will play, but the dates for every game won’t be known until the full schedule reveal Thursday night. Among the other items of interest:Season openerThe Super Bowl champion traditionally hosts a game to kick off the regular season on the Thursday of Week 1, which this year is Sept. 7. If tradition holds, the season opener will see the Chiefs playing one of the following teams on their home schedule: Denver Broncos, Los Angeles Chargers, Las Vegas Raiders, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals or Philadelphia Eagles.Of the 18 previous NFL season openers featuring the defending Super Bowl champion:— 15 featured a conference opponent. Last year, however, the Los Angeles Rams hosted the Bills, breaking a streak of five straight NFL openers featuring conference foes.— Only two featured a division opponent, both involving the New York Giants (New York-Washington in 2008 and New York-Dallas in 2012).One would think a Super Bowl rematch (Chiefs-Eagles), a rematch of the past two AFC championship games (Chiefs-Bengals), or a game between two of the AFC’s top teams (Chiefs-Bills) would be extremely attractive to the NFL and NBC, which will broadcast the season opener (though they may not want Buffalo in the opening game two years in a row). There is precedence for a season-opening Super Bowl rematch: In 2016, the Broncos and Carolina Panthers got the season started after meeting in the previous Super Bowl.Thanksgiving gamesThe Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys will again host their traditional Thanksgiving Day games, with a night game featuring two other teams capping off the holiday.Except for a three-season stretch between 2014 and 2016 when they played three straight conference teams, the Cowboys have alternated between NFC and AFC opponents on Thanksgiving. They played the Giants last year, meaning their Thanksgiving opponent could be either the Patriots or New York Jets, the two AFC teams Dallas will play at home this season (New England played on Thanksgiving evening last season, however). The Cowboys also host Washington, Philadelphia, the New York Giants, Los Angeles Rams, Seattle and Detroit (though the Lions can’t play the Cowboys on Thanksgiving).Detroit’s Thanksgiving opponents also have fallen into something of a pattern. Since the NFL started scheduling three Thanksgiving games in 2006, the Lions have played a division opponent in 10 of 16 seasons, including five of the past seven (they played the Bills last season). Detroit hosts Chicago, Green Bay, Minnesota, Atlanta, Carolina, Denver, Las Vegas and Seattle this season.As for the prime-time Thanksgiving game, it has featured division rivals in all but three years since 2012, though the past two have featured nonconference opponents.More muscle, more problems: How one metric could change NFL trainingChristmas games?Christmas falls on a Monday this year. The last time that happened, in 2017, the NFL scheduled two games on Saturday, Dec. 23; 12 on Christmas Eve; and two on Christmas Day (at 4:30 p.m. Eastern and 8:30 p.m. Eastern).The Sunday of Week 17 this season is New Year’s Eve. The last time that happened, in 2017, all 16 games that week were played on Dec. 31 (all in the afternoon). But the NFL has added a week to the regular season since then, so we could be getting Week 17 games on Thursday and/or Monday this season.What about flex scheduling?Starting in Week 5, the NFL has the option to move games from Sunday afternoon to the prime-time NBC slot on “Sunday Night Football.” Therefore, the games penciled in for Sunday nights starting in Week 5 are not set in stone and may be switched out if a better matchup becomes apparent.Later this month, league owners probably will vote on a proposal to allow for flex scheduling on Thursday night games during Weeks 14-17. If the plan passes, games scheduled for Sunday afternoon can be flexed into the Thursday night time slot with 15 days notice.",

      "title": "How to win at cards and life, according to poker’s autistic superstar",
      "text": "In recent weeks, Dan Cates, widely regarded as one of the best poker players alive, has found himself with a travel itinerary ripped from a spy novel or a video game: He explored temples in Cambodia, learned about Hindu gods in India, toured the largest mosque in Abu Dhabi, hiked through ruins in Guatemala and contemplated heaven and hell at a Buddhist pagoda in Vietnam.At each stop, he studied the people, their history and their culture. And he found himself contemplating the same existential questions that have hounded him since he was a child.Once, when Cates was 12, a girl broke his heart, and he started wondering whether something was wrong with him. So he read the Bible front to back. When he reached the end and the answers hadn’t revealed themselves, he decided to read the whole thing again.That was the same year Cates was diagnosed with autism. He had found an article about the neurodevelopmental disorder, and it felt familiar. His parents took him to Johns Hopkins, where professionals confirmed Cates was on the spectrum. The family could finally begin to understand a unique child who was gifted in math, struggled to connect with other kids and tended to be trusting and blunt, curious and stubborn.It would take some time, but many of the qualities that caused so much frustration in childhood — hyper-focused, analytical, determined — would fuel a meteoric tear through the poker world. Now, at 33, he has a pair of World Series of Poker bracelets and $23 million in career earnings. He’s often referred to as Jungleman, a nod to his longtime screen name on poker sites. But while he built his bankroll through online cash games, he also has made a splash at recent tournaments, dressing in costume when he won his first two bracelets — wrestler “Macho Man” Randy Savage at one, Goku from the Japanese anime series “Dragon Ball Z” at another.And while he has achieved more than even he thought possible, Cates finds himself on dual missions as he crisscrosses the world. Like that 12-year-old with the Bible, he’s on a meandering quest to understand how his brain works and how he can improve every facet of his life. At the same time, Jungleman wants to save the world.“He was kind of shy,” Lillian Cates says of her son today. “And he played a lot by himself.”“He was, like, honest to a fault,” Mark Cates adds. “Some of the kids weren’t as kindhearted as he was, and so he got taken advantage of sometimes.”Growing up around Bowie, Md., Cates struggled to navigate social norms and make meaningful connections. His father coached his intramural basketball team, but Cates was reluctant to shoot. When he finally scored, Mark Cates asked him how it felt. The boy had no reaction.At school, he once matter-of-factly called a classmate a “slow thinker.” That got his parents thinking some self-defense classes might be in order. But during karate lessons, Cates was averse to throwing punches. The instructor inquired: “What’s wrong? Don’t you want to hit this guy?”“No,” Cates replied, “I really don't.”The autism diagnosis brought calm and concern. The family was happy to have a framework to better understand Cates’s behavior but worried about his long-term future, relationships and job prospects.“I was a loner, and I didn’t really have friends,” Cates says. “I didn’t know how to make friends. I didn’t know how any of that worked.”They attended group meetings with other families and children who were on the spectrum, and Cates did one-on-one therapy. But it wasn’t until he found video games and, later, poker that he started to find purpose and an outlet.Cates took up cards at 15. He would play during lunch with classmates, using torn pieces of paper as chips. The game hooked him. It was analytical, involved calculated risk and offered a monetary reward. “No one really cared as much as me,” he says. “I just was super focused on playing and getting better.”He learned lessons about ethics and trust early on. Playing with classmates, Cates was duped when a boy sat behind him and tipped off the other players to which cards Cates was holding. He lost a few thousand dollars before he caught on.Cates wasn’t deterred. He took a job working the drive-through window at McDonald’s to build back his stash, determined to get better.With a near-perfect SAT score, Cates earned a scholarship to the University of Maryland. But by then, he had discovered online poker. He started with modest 25-/50-cent games, struggling to win but paying special attention to more successful players. When he won a tournament worth $5,000, he reinvested most of his winnings into an online training course.Cates was winning, but his grades were suffering. He was put on academic probation after a semester, and his parents noticed he was never calling home and asking for money.“I said, ‘So what’s going on?’ ” his father recalls. “He said: ‘Well, I’ve been gambling online, Dad. I made $33,000.’ I told him: ‘$33,000? You’ll make way, way more than that as an engineer.’ ”His grades kept slipping, but Cates kept winning. He took a summer internship at his father’s engineering firm and earned $17 an hour, grumbling the whole time about the lousy pay. In the fall of his sophomore year, he earned $300,000 playing cards, and his parents could no longer use the money argument.Cates eventually lost his academic scholarship. By his junior year, he was a millionaire and poker wasn’t the distraction — school was.“I could focus on poker, or I could go back and write book reports and take these math classes that I don’t remember one thing from,” he says now. “So the decision was really clear for me.”In 2009, poker player Tom Dwan, who played under the screen name “Durrrr,” created a stir when he issued the Durrrr Challenge, offering $1.5 million to any competitor who could best him after 50,000 hands of heads-up poker. If Dwan won, the loser would pay $500,000. Jungleman, already an online poker legend, answered the call in 2010.Cates’s parents recall monitoring the first night of action on Full Tilt Poker. It was close to midnight, and Cates, who was playing in his bedroom, was down about $750,000. Lillian pleaded with her husband, “Pull the internet, pull the internet!”“I told her, ‘I’m not pulling the internet — that’s his money,’ ” Mark says.When they woke up the next morning, the tables had turned and Cates was up some $750,000.“I remember asking him, ‘Are you worried you’re going to lose that money?’ ” Mark says. “And he said, ‘No, Durrrr can’t handle what I’m doing to him.’ ”Cates led by more than $1 million after 20,000 hands, but the game fizzled. Cates says his foe has paid him around $1.3 million from the challenge, but Dwan has resisted resuming play.Autism is a constant companion. Cates says it helped him learn the game, stirred an obsession and catered to his analytical instincts. He credits the diagnosis with helping him make decisions backed by logic, not emotion, and with his ability to identify others’ playing patterns and quickly calculate probabilities.But it also forced him to confront his own behavior. The online game was easy: Opponents couldn’t read his visual cues, and he could quickly detect other players’ habits and rely on odds. He loved the fast pace and would often play multiple hands simultaneously — at up to eight tables at a time. But in person, losses stung and Cates was prone to outbursts. One casino barred him for six months after he slammed a glass too hard on the table and it shattered.Cates realized that, to get invited to big cash games, he needed to improve his social skills. He needed to become not just a good poker player but someone whom others would want at their table. So he went looking for answers.Seeking confirmation, he was again diagnosed with autism at 23 and then again at 31, when Cates learned he also has mild dyspraxia, a condition that can affect motor skills, and ADHD, impacting virtually every facet of his life and the way he engages with the world around him.“That was the point where I realized I really needed to solve this,” he says.Cates started taking acting and improv lessons to help him engage and respond. He took cooking classes and threw house parties so he could better interact in social settings. He tracks his sleep, practices yoga, does breathing exercises and works out regularly, striving to be the best version of himself.He studied the Alexander Technique, a movement therapy focused on posture and bodily function. He consulted psychics and astrologists to help him consider life’s possibilities, and he recently climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to test his physical limits. He has studied mysticism and world religions, and he personally sought out Indian spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.“I wanted to see if it was real,” he says. “In my head, I’m reading these stories and I’m thinking: ‘Is there really an enlightenment? Are there really people who have magic powers? Is there really, like, divine characters or whatever?’ ”Cates slowly evolved from an introvert with few friends to someone receiving invites to big games around the world.Nick Schulman, a pro player who has three bracelets of his own, says Cates is “squarely in the top three best players ever.” At the table, Cates is often operating on levels that most people simply can’t appreciate. Schulman says it’s not like watching Stephen Curry heat up beyond the arc and rain in three-pointers.“It’s a lot more subtle,” he says. “He has a very special poker mind. He understands the way the cards interact.”One key: keeping opponents on their toes. At two of his biggest tournament wins — in 2021 and 2022 at the Poker Players Championship, considered one of the most prestigious events on the calendar — he competed in costume. Dressed last year as Savage, the gruff and wild-eyed pro wrestler, Cates sought to defend his title by tapping into some method acting, remaining in character as he muttered at the table — a performance for TV cameras perhaps but also a distraction for his foes. All the while, he read the other players and waited for his chance to bet big.“To succeed at poker, you need to be able to change your strategy if things aren’t working,” he says. “It’s like that constant search for — I would just say a search for truth.”Cates was either lost in his own head or unable to appreciate how his actions affected others. Or, most likely, both. In 2020, he was publicly outed for “ghosting” in a lucrative private game online, essentially playing incognito on behalf of a recreational player.He justified his actions at the time by saying he thought the game was “rampant with professionals who were ghosting” and so “it felt acceptable for me to be playing.” But as much of the poker world lobbed criticism his way, he started to appreciate that he had duped at least some innocent players and that his actions affect others.Cates reflected on his behavior at the table and also away from it, lamenting the times he felt he was taking more than he was giving — “stealing from the environment, if that makes sense,” he says.When he was 29, Cates was on an airplane watching a time-hopping science-fiction film called “Looper,” in which a character kills himself to spare the world of future misdeeds. He matter-of-factly says he had an epiphany of sorts, suddenly recognizing the connectivity of everything — of people, of their actions, of their energy — even of history.“It just blew my mind. And I had this state of, like, ecstasy,” he says. “I wasn’t on any drugs, but it was very lucid. I could think super clearly for four days straight. This is a natural phenomenon. Apparently, it happens — I looked it up — but it’s very rare.”He thought about the movie as the medium for his epiphany, and the power of art, music, books, media and gaming. He contemplated a purpose and mission beyond poker and questioned the role the game should play in his future. He came to realize that poker had more to offer than stacks of chips and occasional bracelets, that the virtues of the game were applicable elsewhere.“It’s a game,” he says, “but through poker, many different things can be seen and many different things actually can be taught.”Professional poker can be a lonely world. It calls for a nomadic lifestyle, requiring trust in a world populated by gamblers and swindlers. It would be easy for an introvert such as Cates to remain a screen name — to stay Jungleman forever — and keep growing his stack online.But as he’s figuring himself out, Cates thinks he’s starting to understand everything around him. Autism gave him lifelong challenges, but it also provided some of the tools to navigate them — to flourish, even.He launched a wide-ranging podcast called “Winning the Game of Life” that is ostensibly rooted in poker and includes interviews with many of the game’s biggest personalities. But it takes huge detours. He also started a charitable organization focused on food, clothing and education programming in underserved communities, particularly those in Africa.Yet there’s so much more he wants to do: visit Antarctica, the Galápagos Islands, the Himalayas, the Amazon; improve his physique; learn kung fu; maintain better relationships; maybe even find love.But it’s all connected to a broader vision that is still coming into focus. Cates sees himself as a leader and a uniter, someone who can draw people together and encourage collaboration. Poker gave him purpose. Now he wants to use it to reach others.Cates still doesn’t have all the answers. But he’s starting to think that’s the point.Recently, he says, he was playing a video game that allowed users to pay money to bypass levels. Before long, Cates, a globe-trotting multimillionaire with the means to indulge most any whim, had reached the end of the game — and felt unfulfilled.“I realized: ‘Oh, s---, I’ve kind of now gotten everything. Now what am I going to do?’ ” he says. “Maybe it was better if instead of paying for the higher points, I’d just taken the slower route and appreciated it a bit more.”",

      "text": "As their search for a new general manager continues, the Washington Wizards have begun making changes to Coach Wes Unseld Jr.’s staff. Alex McLean, the director of player development, and Dean Oliver, an assistant coach who specializes in analytics, will not be returning to the team, according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation.The moves indicate that Unseld will have greater power in shaping his coaching staff under the Wizards’ new regime.When he was hired in 2021, Unseld’s assistants were mostly either inherited or hired without much of his input, which is not entirely unusual, especially for a first-time head coach. Former general manager Tommy Sheppard hired Oliver to coach Scott Brooks’s staff ahead of the 2019-20 season and McLean joined the Wizards in 2017. Oliver is a pioneer of basketball’s analytics movement whose book, “Basketball on Paper,” introduced the importance of the “four factors” of effective field goal percentage, offensive rebound percentage, free throw rate and turnover rate, which are now so commonly known that they exist as a category on the NBA’s public-facing stats page. He had previously worked in the front offices of the Seattle SuperSonics, Denver Nuggets and Sacramento Kings.McLean, who was promoted to assistant coach in 2021, was heavily involved with player development for six years and had become especially close with franchise cornerstone Bradley Beal.Meanwhile, Wizards Owner Ted Leonsis remains in the early stages of a general manager search, according to people in rival front offices and close to the organization.Leonsis and a small group of decision-makers have had initial conversations with Milwaukee Bucks assistant general manager Milt Newton and New Orleans Pelicans General Manager Trajan Langdon, but many close to the organization describe Leonsis as still in the information-gathering stage.",

      "text": "Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic won’t be suspended after making contact with Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia during a playoff game Sunday night.The NBA said Monday that Jokic had been fined $25,000 “for making improper contact with a spectator sitting courtside” but did not announce a suspension. That spectator just happened to be the opposing team’s owner.The following was released by the NBA. pic.twitter.com/uMB9t5nvi4The incident occurred with 2:36 left before halftime of Game 4 of the teams’ Western Conference semifinal series in Phoenix when Suns forward Josh Okogie flew toward the courtside seats across from the Suns bench, where Ishbia was sitting. Jokic headed into the crowd to retrieve the ball when he made contact with Ishbia.As Jokic tried to take the ball from Ishbia, it flew farther into the crowd and Jokic’s left forearm connected with Ishbia’s chest as Jokic gestured for the ball. Ishbia, who played on Michigan State’s NCAA championship team in 2000, fell backward into his seat; referee crew chief Tony Brothers determined the shove to be intentional, so he issued Jokic a technical foul.Ishbia had tweeted his belief earlier Monday that a suspension or fine would be unwarranted.“Great win for the Suns last night in an amazing series so far!” he wrote. “That should be and is the only story. Suspending or fining anyone over last night’s incident would not be right. I have alot of respect for Jokic and don’t want to see anything like that. Excited for game 5! Go Suns!”James Harden hits all the right notes as 76ers win Game 4 to knot seriesBrothers described the incident to a pool reporter after the game and explained why he issued Jokic, a two-time league MVP, the technical foul.“One of the fans was holding the ball, Jokic came to get the ball, grabbed it away from the fan,” Brothers said. “Then after that, he deliberately gave him a shove and pushed him down, so he was issued an unsportsmanlike technical foul.” Brothers added that he decided not to eject Jokic because he “didn’t just run over and hit a fan. … There was some engagement, so I deemed the technical foul the appropriate penalty.”Should Nikola Jokic receive more punishment for the elbow on Suns owner Mat Ishbia?Or did Ishbia flop? 🧐pic.twitter.com/pvqagkNc83Jokic, who scored a career-best 53 points in Denver’s 129-124 loss, which tied the series at 2, told reporters afterward that he just wanted to get the next play started quickly while trying to get Ishbia, whom he referred to as a “fan,” off him.“He told me I was elbowing the fan,” Jokic said of his interaction with officials, “but the fan put the hand on me first. I thought the league is supposed to protect us, or whatever, but maybe I’m wrong.”Here’s Nikola Jokic’s postgame comments about the interaction with “the fan” not caring who the fan is, just that it limited him his chance to get a 5-on-4 with Okogie on the ground. And that Ishbia touched him first.@KOAColorado #MileHighBasketball #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/bwetA9Gq4lAsked if he knew who the fan was and told that it was Ishbia, Jokic replied, “I know who he is, but he’s a fan, isn’t he?” He added that Ishbia was “influencing the game. I think he’s supposed to get kicked out if he’s influencing the game.”Ishbia, whose purchase of the Suns was approved by NBA owners in February, told the Associated Press at halftime that he was “fine” after the incident. Phoenix star Devin Booker praised the owner for helping out the Suns, who tied the series at 2. “He got us a point!” Booker joked to reporters, referring to the technical free throw converted by Kevin Durant. “He did his job.”Game 5 is Tuesday night in Denver.Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

      "title": "Russia preparing to evacuate nuclear plant, Ukrainian operator says",
      "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russian authorities controlling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine are preparing to evacuate about 3,100 staff from areas in and around the facility, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear operator said Monday.The plant pullout is being planned as occupying Russian authorities evacuate civilians from communities around the facility, the largest of its kind in Europe, in advance of a potential Ukrainian offensive in the south, Energoatom President Petro Kotin told The Washington Post.The Russian-appointed governor of occupied Zaporizhzhia said Sunday that about 1,600 civilians had been moved out Enerhodar, home to the plant and many of its employees, and other communities. He cited “intensified shelling” by Ukrainian forces.“What is most actually concerning for us is that we also have information that there are 3,100 people, workers from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, who are to be evacuated from the area,” Kotin said.“They are preparing for this advance of Ukrainian forces. And if this happens, then they want to be prepared … to leave the area,” he said. But if the staff is evacuated, he said, “there will be lack of personnel just to operate the plant.”The situation is becoming “unpredictable and potentially dangerous,” the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog warned over the weekend.“I’m extremely concerned about the very real nuclear safety and security risks facing the plant,” said Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. “We must act now to prevent the threat of a severe nuclear accident and its associated consequences for the population and the environment.”What to know about Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plantKotin said he learned about preparations for a staff pullout on Sunday.Ukraine has been planning for months to launch a large-scale counteroffensive aimed at retaking territory  under Russian control. Analysts believe the nuclear plant, a major source of electricity and income for Ukraine, will be a top priority.Evgeniy Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor of occupied Zaporizhzhia, said he had ordered the evacuation of more than a dozen settlements near the plant.“In this regard, I decided to remove, first of all, children with their parents, the elderly, the disabled, patients of medical institutions from enemy fire and move them from the front-line territories deep into the region,” he wrote on Telegram.About 11,000 people worked at the nuclear power plant before the war, Kotin said. Of the employees who remain, he said, about 2,700 have signed contracts with the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, or Rosatom. About 1,500 are still employed by Ukraine’s Energoatom.Altogether, there are currently about 4,000 staff working at or around the plant — “the exact amount needed for operation,” Kotin said.“If they go out and then we recapture the plant and return it under our control, then we will have challenges to … just operate the plant,” he said.Some infrastructure at the plant requires constant supervision, he said. Eliminating that oversight “will be dangerous for the plant itself.”He noted that Russian forces have transformed the plant into a military base that serves as a kind of shelter, because they believe Ukrainian forces are unlikely to target it.“More and more soldiers are coming on-site and they are constantly living [there],” he said.Grossi, of the IAEA, has been pushing Russia and Ukraine to agree to a special security zone around the plant to avoid a potentially disastrous leak of nuclear materials.The nuclear watchdog said Saturday that its personnel assigned to the power plant had not been able to travel to Enerhodar in the previous several days. It also noted that Yuriy Chernichuk, the Russian-appointed plant site director, has said staff are not being evacuated.A Ukrainian employee of the plant said evacuation buses are seen daily, but that “who exactly is traveling is not visible” because the windows are covered with curtains.The employee spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns.“Ukrainian personnel are not going to evacuate,” the employee said. Those employed by Rosatom are next due to report to work after May 10, the day after Russia’s Victory Day celebrations to commemorate the end of World War II. “Then we’ll see,” the employee said.The evacuations, Kotin said, are a sign that Russian forces are “scared and trying to be ready to get out of there.”Kamila Hrabchuk in Dnipro, Ukraine, contributed to this report.Portraits of Ukraine: Every Ukrainian’s life has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion one year ago — in ways both big and small. They have learned to survive and support each other under extreme circumstances, in bomb shelters and hospitals, destroyed apartment complexes and ruined marketplaces. Scroll through portraits of Ukrainians reflecting on a year of loss, resilience and fear.Battle of attrition: Over the past year, the war has morphed from a multi-front invasion that included Kyiv in the north to a conflict of attrition largely concentrated along an expanse of territory in the east and south. Follow the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces and take a look at where the fighting has been concentrated.A year of living apart: Russia’s invasion, coupled with Ukraine’s martial law preventing fighting-age men from leaving the country, has forced agonizing decisions for millions of Ukrainian families about how to balance safety, duty and love, with once-intertwined lives having become unrecognizable. Here’s what a train station full of goodbyes looked like last year.Deepening global divides: President Biden has trumpeted the reinvigorated Western alliance forged during the war as a “global coalition,” but a closer look suggests the world is far from united on issues raised by the Ukraine war. Evidence abounds that the effort to isolate Putin has failed and that sanctions haven’t stopped Russia, thanks to its oil and gas exports.",

      "title": "Analysis | Durbin ups the pressure on Feinstein — gently",
      "text": "If there’s one Senate Judiciary Committee Democrat besides Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) who most gives the liberal wing of their party fits, it might be Feinstein’s successor as the panel’s top Democrat, Chair Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). And Durbin’s gentle handling of calls from the left for Feinstein to resign has only exacerbated the situation.But if you look closely at Durbin’s comments this weekend, you begin to see him applying some pressure.The big headlines from Durbin’s CNN interview tended to focus on host Jake Tapper’s line of questioning. “I mean, all due respect, sir, you and your fellow Democrats were very ginger and very polite when it came to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in not pushing her to retire when you had a Democratic majority in the Senate,” Tapper said. “How did that work out for you? How did that work out for Roe v. Wade?”That’s an eminently fair point, which we dissected here. Feinstein’s defenders can note that it’s rare to apply pressure on an ailing senator to resign, but the stakes here are also rare. Democrats’ majority and time to confirm judges could be running short, and Feinstein’s absence — she was hospitalized in March for shingles — means Republicans can block them.But while Durbin offered general and sympathetic comments about how this is up to Feinstein, 89, he also undercut her defense for holding out. And he even seemed to question her pledge that she would be back.In a statement last week, Feinstein maintained that despite her absence on the Judiciary Committee, “There has been no slowdown.”Durbin seemed to take issue with this, albeit without directly addressing it. He pointed to Democrats’ inability to subpoena people to probe reports on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, such as Leonard Leo and Harlan Crow, if they decided they wanted to.“We need her,” he said. “It is a challenge in the Senate Judiciary Committee to do our business.”Durbin later repeated this, while alluding to the fact that this situation is different than other senators who have been absent for long stretches because of illness.“I don’t want to say that she’s going to be put under more pressure than others have been in the past,” he said. “But the bottom line is: The business of the committee and of the Senate is affected by her absence.”In addition, Feinstein’s statement last week treated her return as inevitable — i.e., she said “when I return to the Senate” — but Durbin notably intimated it was possible that she wouldn’t.“I hope she does what’s best for her and her family and the state of California and makes a decision soon as to whether she’s coming back,” he said.Durbin’s commentary is clearly less favorable to Feinstein than some of her most ardent defenders.Some like  Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) have suggested the calls for her to resign are sexist. Others like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is running to replace Feinstein, have suggested it might be pointless — because Republicans might not seat a replacement on the committee.(The GOP has blocked a temporary replacement for Feinstein, but not replacing a resigned senator and depriving the majority party of a majority on the committee would set a remarkable new precedent. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), the committee’s senior Republican, has assured he would support replacing Feinstein in that situation.)Durbin’s comments, importantly, indicate even top Democrats don’t appear to have clarity on when Feinstein might be able to return. The photographed notes of Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) last week indicated he was “hopeful” she would come back this week, but Feinstein’s office said there was no timeline for her return.Questions about Feinstein’s ability to serve have lingered for years, which also colors the situation. The New York Times editorial board on Friday argued that it was just about decision time.“If she cannot fulfill her obligations to the Senate and to her constituents, she should resign and turn over her responsibilities to an appointed successor,” it said. “If she is unable to reach that decision on her own, Mr. Schumer, the majority leader, and other Democratic senators should make it clear to her and the public how important it is that she do so.”Durbin’s comments move the ball forward on that — subtly, of course.",

Russian authorities are preparing to evacuate about 3,100 staff from areas in and around the plant, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear operator said Monday. Nuclear energy experts have warned that fighting near the facility could lead to the disastrous leak of nuclear materials.Nearly 1,700 people — including 660 children — have been evacuated from the area already, according to a Moscow-installed official.Russia launched a swarm of more than 30 Iranian-made drones at the Ukrainian capital in an early-morning air attack Monday, according to Kyiv officials, injuring at least five people and damaging cars and buildings. Kyiv’s military administrator said the hours-long attack marked the fourth time Moscow has targeted the capital in eight days, as it ramps up the frequency of its strikes on the city.Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe. Ukraine has exceeded expectations for 15 months. Now senior leaders are trying to lower those hopes. Ukraine is readying a much anticipated spring assault to seize back territory occupied by Russia. But senior leaders are worried that the advance buildup — aimed at tilting the war in Kyiv’s favor — won’t live up to expectations, Siobhán O’Grady, Isabelle Khurshudyan, Laris Karklis and Samuel Granados report.“The expectation from our counteroffensive campaign is overestimated in the world,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in an interview. “Most people are … waiting for something huge,” he added, which he fears may lead to “emotional disappointment.”Karen DeYoung, Kostiantyn Khudov and Siobhán O’Grady contributed to this report.",

Gretchen Whitmer (D), announced a Democratic bid Tuesday for a New York congressional seat that Democrats narrowly lost last year and see as one of their best pickup opportunities next year as they try to reclaim control of the House.The seat, in the northern New York City suburbs, is held by Rep. Michael Lawler (R), who pulled off a stunning upset last year of Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D), then the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Underscoring the importance of the area to Democrats, President Biden plans to hold a campaign-style event near Lawler’s district in Westchester County on Wednesday to highlight the fight with Republicans over the debt limit. Biden carried Lawler’s district over then-President Donald Trump in 2020.In announcing her congressional bid, Gereghty highlighted her service on the local school board, casting herself as someone who can “find common ground and make things happen.”“But today, extreme Republican leaders in Congress — enabled by the current 17th District Congressman — are threatening our core rights, our safety and our economic future,” she said. “Instead of solving problems, they are trying to roll back women’s reproductive rights, blocking even modest gun safety measures, threatening to default on the debt, and spending more time worrying about how to ban books than helping our families and small businesses thrive. That has to change.”While Gereghty is expected to benefit from the star power of her sister, she is new to congressional politics, and she may not have the Democratic primary field to herself.Former congressman Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), who ran unsuccessfully in another district last year, is considering a comeback bid in the 17th. And Maloney, who lost to Lawler by only 1,800 votes, has not ruled out seeking a rematch.Gereghty stressed in her announcement that she has lived in New York’s Hudson Valley for more than 20 years.“New York’s 17th Congressional District is my home,” she said. “It’s where I raised my three children, started my own small business in Katonah, had the privilege of signing somebody’s first paycheck, oversaw an education budget of over $100 million as a school board member, and led the effort to improve our school facilities and ensure a quality public education for all of our kids.”",

      "text": "A day after he was hit in the face by a line drive, Kansas City Royals pitcher Ryan Yarbrough was placed on the injured list Monday with what his team described as “head fractures.”Royals Manager Matt Quatraro subsequently told reporters that the 31-year-old left-hander has three non-displaced fractures near his right eye.“He’s stable, improving,” Quatraro said of Yarbrough before the Royals’ game Monday against the visiting Chicago White Sox. “He never lost consciousness. He’s very aware of what’s going on around him, in normal conversations.”Yarbrough was at the center of a scary scene Sunday at Kansas City’s Kauffman Stadium while pitching against the Oakland Athletics. In the sixth inning, he threw a pitch that was timed at 106.2 mph when it came back off the bat of Oakland’s Ryan Noda.The ball bounced off the face of Yarbrough, who crumpled to the ground as catcher Salvador Perez fielded it and got the out at first. Yarbrough held his head in his hands for a few moments as trainers and teammates gathered at the mound, then was able to leave the field with some assistance while holding a towel to his face.Somehow (and thankfully) Ryan Yarbrough was able to walk off the field on his own power after getting drilled by this line drive pic.twitter.com/yfbEgyk4UmA scary moment in the game as Ryan Yarbrough was hit in the face with a line drive.The Royals' starter was able to get up walk off the field with some assistance. pic.twitter.com/6EOSDjQx0MImmediately after the game, a 5-1 Royals win, Quatraro said, “I can’t think of a worse thing to see on the field.”“The dugout went silent,” the manager added then. “I mean, everybody — your heart drops there, you get a pit in your stomach. Luckily, when we got out there, he was talking and aware of what was going on and what had happened. But he was swollen immediately. There was some blood. You just didn’t know exactly where it was coming from.”The Royals said Monday that Yarbrough was set for further testing, and they “do not believe he will need surgery.”Yarbrough had pitched well before getting injured Sunday. Over 5⅔ innings, he allowed three hits and one earned run, and he got the win, improving his record to 1-4.Drafted in 2014 out of Old Dominion University by the Seattle Mariners, Yarbrough was traded to Tampa Bay in 2017 and reached the majors with the Rays in the following year. He spent five seasons with Tampa Bay before signing a one-year deal with Kansas City in December as a free agent.With Yarbrough going on the 15-day IL, the Royals recalled relief pitcher Jose Cuas from its Class AAA affiliate. It was not immediately clear who would get Friday’s spot in the rotation in place of Yarbrough, who has pitched both this season and over his career as a starter and a reliever.",

      "title": "Analysis | The Warriors were pushed to the brink on a night filled with regrets",
      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Stephen Curry gnawed on his mouthguard, stared at the hardwood and repeatedly shook his head as he wandered back and forth, trying to make sense of a two-minute stretch that just might spell the end of the Golden State Warriors’ title defense.The two-time MVP should have been putting the finishing touches on a brilliant triple-double and shimmying his way back to the Bay Area with a tied series against the Los Angeles Lakers. Instead, Curry missed a pair of potential game-winners and endured another timeout blunder, while Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, his longtime running mates, both made questionable decisions down the stretch of the Lakers’ 104-101 Game 4 victory at Crypto.com Arena on Monday.Curry, Thompson and Green have more shared big-game experience than any other current trio in the NBA. Their four rings and six Finals appearances have been made possible by too many clutch shots and crucial stops to quickly recount. Yet Golden State’s three stars unraveled together in the closing minutes this time, taking turns adding to a night filled with regrets. The Lakers, more poised when it counted and boosted by an unlikely hero in Lonnie Walker IV, capitalized to claim a 3-1 series lead before Wednesday’s Game 5 in San Francisco.“We fought down all the way to the last second to try to give ourselves a chance to steal a win,” Curry said. “In the fourth quarter, we only scored 17 points. That’s a tough way to finish.”Walker, a backup guard who has played sparingly in the playoffs, scored all 15 of his points in the fourth quarter to help power the Lakers’ comeback. His two free throws with 15 seconds left provided the game’s final margin and completed a 20-for-20 night from the foul line for Los Angeles. LeBron James led five Lakers in double figures with 27 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and Anthony Davis added 23 points and 15 rebounds in another strong performance.The Warriors, blindsided by Walker’s biggest scoring night since March 24 and unable to execute offensively when it mattered, resorted to desperate measures due to the looming possibility of elimination.“We had three or four illegal screens called,” Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said, quibbling with the officials for the first time in this series. “That was disappointing. The Lakers are a team that plays with a lot of gamesmanship. They understand how to generate some calls. I thought they took some flops and were rewarded.”Before the flat ending, Golden State opened the night seeking a jolt and getting it. After going small to claim a Game 2 blowout win, the Warriors went even smaller in Game 4 by starting guard Gary Payton II in place of forward JaMychal Green. With a micro-ball lineup composed of five players who are all listed at 6-foot-7 or shorter, Golden State sought to lure Davis away from the hoop and to shore up its backcourt defense with Payton.That strategy paid dividends on both fronts, as Golden State held a 12-point lead with four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Payton scored 15 points mostly by cutting and diving to the rim behind the defense, and Lakers guard D’Angelo Russell managed just four points after a strong showing in Game 3.But the Warriors, too dependent on Curry for scoring with sixth man Jordan Poole mired in an extended slump, squandered their double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. Thompson hit a three-pointer to give the Warriors a 99-96 lead with three minutes left, but after that the wheels fell off.An emboldened Thompson, who scored just nine points on 3-for-11 shooting, immediately sought backbreaking shots on Golden State’s next two possessions. Both of his low-percentage attempts missed.“I trust Klay,” Kerr said. “Think of everything he’s done for this team. There were a couple late he would probably like to have back. That’s part of who we are as a team. We’re going to fire.”On the other end, James successfully hunted Curry in pick and rolls, using his size advantage to draw two fouls that led to four points on free throws. Curry answered with a driving layup with just over a minute to play, but he couldn’t shake free from Davis with Los Angeles clinging to a 102-101 lead on Golden State’s next possession. After briefly losing his handle and circling back around, Curry shot a tough midrange jumper over Davis, which rattled out. Green claimed an offensive rebound, and Curry used the second chance to launch a deep three-pointer that came up short with under 20 seconds left. Curry finished with a game-high 31 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists, but he shot just 3 for 14 from beyond the arc.“A lot of [the misses] were back rim, which, for me, means you’ve got good legs and good lift,” Curry said. “They just didn’t go down. The first one [against Davis] was a nice little step-back, and it was in and out. It felt good. The second one, it was a little rushed but obviously I took it because I thought I could make it. I’m living with those.”Curry’s misses forced the Warriors to foul to stop the clock, and Walker sank two free throws to give the Lakers a 104-101 lead with 15 seconds left. Golden State never got another shot off.Green initiated the final possession by driving to the basket, but he chose not to shoot and tossed a careless pass across the court, which was intercepted by Davis. The Warriors tied up Davis to force a jump ball with five seconds left, and Curry leaped high to claim the loose ball.Unfortunately, the force of his effort sent him falling to the ground and he didn’t have the presence of mind to call timeout. Kerr said that he had unsuccessfully tried to call one from the sideline before Curry tossed the ball over his head, hoping to find a teammate in the open court behind him.As the ball trickled harmlessly out of bounds and the Los Angeles crowd erupted, the Warriors were left to rue Thompson’s overeagerness, Green’s indecision and Curry’s second timeout-related imbroglio of the postseason. During a Game 4 win over the Sacramento Kings in the first round, Curry called a timeout when the Warriors had already used their full allotment, triggering a technical foul. Against the Lakers, he missed an opportunity to reset for a game-tying shot by leaving an unused timeout in his pocket.“I didn’t realize how long or how much time had run off and how long I was on the ground,” Curry said. “It felt like someone was behind me and I just let it go. It was a bang-bang play. I wish I had a little more awareness to maybe call a timeout knowing we had enough time. It just didn’t go our way.”Golden State now faces its third 3-1 deficit of Kerr’s tenure after completing a comeback victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2016 Western Conference finals and falling in six games to the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 Finals. Of course, the Warriors know the other side of the equation, as they famously blew a 3-1 lead to James’s Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 Finals.Winning three straight times against a bigger, steadier and more physical opponent will be a monumental task for the Warriors, who already had to fight out of an 0-2 hole against the Kings and win a Game 7 in Sacramento. Curry dismissed a question about whether a second-round exit could prompt major offseason changes to the roster or front office, and Kerr attempted to narrow his team’s focus to Game 5.“You go home and take care of business and the momentum is right back in your favor,” Kerr said. “That’s why you play it out.”Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

      "title": "Analysis | The brazen explanation for concealing the Ginni Thomas payment",
      "text": "Clarence Thomas’s argument for accepting billionaire GOP donor Harlan Crow’s largesse over the years and not disclosing it leans heavily on the claim that Crow didn’t have business before the court.That defense isn’t going to cut it when it comes to the news that conservative judicial activist and Thomas family ally Leonard Leo proactively obscured a payment to Thomas’s wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas. So Leo has gone with a different and rather blunt explanation. Effectively it’s: Yes, I did it, because I wanted to hide it.The Washington Post reported late Thursday that documents show Leo in 2012 instructed GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway to bill a nonprofit he advises and pay Ginni Thomas $25,000. He also told her, “No mention of Ginni, of course.”The nonprofit, the Judicial Education Project, would go on to file multiple amicus briefs to the court in key cases. In other words, the source of the money Ginni Thomas was paid later had plenty of interest in the decisions of the court on which her husband serves.The key questions include how much Thomas knew about his wife’s work. (The couple have long maintained that they keep Ginni Thomas’s conservative activism separate from Justice Thomas’s jurisprudence and don’t discuss each other’s work.) Beyond that, there are questions of how much money Leo might have directed to Ginni Thomas over the years and what kind of work she did for him, given that these matters could also have ties to the Supreme Court.But also, consider Leo’s explanation.In a statement, he said of his move to keep Ginni Thomas’s name off the paperwork: “Knowing how disrespectful, malicious and gossipy people can be, I have always tried to protect the privacy of Justice Thomas and Ginni.”First, what else is he going to say? There was clearly an effort to shield the connection. Second, this is Leo effectively saying he was justified in obscuring that connection because it might be made to look bad. He might contend it would unfairly be made to look bad. But it’s the opposite of the concept of transparency, which holds that matters involving public officials should be there for everyone to evaluate, and that people should draw their own conclusions about potential conflicts of interest.Thomas’s own approach to these matters, it would seem, mirrors Leo’s.He once disclosed the luxury trips and expensive gifts he accepted from Crow. But after the Los Angeles Times in 2004 cast a spotlight on them using those disclosures, Thomas stopped disclosing them (save for one gift in 2015).Likewise, Thomas in 2002 disclosed a $5,000 gift for the education of a grandnephew he had custody of and was raising as a son. But when Crow reportedly paid for the same grandnephew’s $6,200 monthly private boarding school tuition later that decade, Thomas did not disclose it. (We only learned about this Thursday.)In 2011, Thomas announced he would amend 13 years’ worth of filings after it was pointed out they should have included his wife’s employers. But just three years later, in 2014, he failed to disclose a real estate sale involving Crow that ostensibly was covered by the very same disclosure laws. An article on the Volokh Conspiracy blog on Thursday offered a plausible explanation for this. It cited Thomas’s writings in both the landmark Citizens United case and another. In them, Thomas took a dim view of the impacts of disclosure requirements. He argued that in some cases they can chill speech that is constitutionally protected.The piece then offered this rather sympathetic summary.“I think we can draw a general sense of how Justice Thomas approaches ethics rules: Justice Thomas discloses what he is required to disclose, but declines to disclose optional information that would allow critics to attack him, his family, and his friends,” it says. “Thomas’s apparent goal is not to shield any actual or apparent conflicts of interest. … His goal seems to be to protect his privacy from critics that have been trying to destroy him for more three decades.”But Thomas has in fact failed to disclose all that he was required to, by his own admission. And it’s not difficult to see how this kind of sense of persecution could be used to justify plenty to yourself — and in the process create even more problems.The timeline here is also key. That’s because Leo’s move to obscure the payment to Ginni Thomas came a little more than a year after Ginni Thomas departed her own nonprofit amid conflict-of-interest and other questions.The group, Liberty Central, was launched with the help of a $500,000 anonymous contribution (later reported to have been from Crow). It also put out a 2010 memo with her name on it labeling then-President Barack Obama’s proposed health-care overhaul unconstitutional. The latter was a problem because it was logical to assume such questions might come before Justice Thomas’s court (which they ultimately did). So the nonprofit took her name off the memo. After these and other issues, Ginni Thomas stepped down in November 2020, with the nonprofit citing “distractions.”Leo served on the board of Liberty Central.The payment from the Judicial Education Project also, notably, came a year after Justice Thomas acknowledged that he had incorrectly omitted his wife’s employers from his disclosures and amended the reports.The lesson Leo took from all of this was apparently that the best course was to obscure these matters, to avoid rekindling that debate. The problem with that approach is that when it does come out, it looks a lot like a coverup.That’s not exactly a recipe for avoiding suspicion, whether “malicious” or otherwise. Nor is it a recipe for instilling confidence in a conservative justice whose ethics even many Republicans are now questioning.",

      "title": "Analysis | Musk shares baseless election claim with millions of Twitter users",
      "text": "Donald Trump’s insistence that he won the 2020 presidential election despite his having lost the 2020 presidential election put a lot of his allies in a bind.Republican elected officials had to choose: Would they risk irritating an active, voluble set of Republican voters, or would they affirm the obvious election results? They at least had the option to stay quiet, an option of which many availed themselves. Media outlets such as Fox News couldn’t, having to pick between coddling Trump supporters by echoing Trump’s false claims about fraud or recognizing the reality of the election outcome.Eventually a third option emerged. Trump allies and those otherwise interested in appealing to a right-wing audience decided that the election had been stolen not through unproven and unprovable voter fraud but instead through devious left-wing machinations. It was the media’s fault, for its coverage, for example. Arguments like that had the benefit of being vague and hard to measure, the rhetorical equivalent of attributing things to vibes.There was one concrete claim made, however. The 2020 election was tainted or even determined by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose contribution to a group called Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) increased turnout in Democratic areas, making the difference for Joe Biden. This claim had multiple benefits, among them that it leverage right-wing hostility to large social media companies. The idea that “Zuckbucks” — as the contribution was dubbed — had cost Republicans the election became a mantra among those interested in piggybacking onto Trump’s feverish claims about the results.On Tuesday, Elon Musk joined them.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpOut of the blue, Musk shared an article on Twitter from October 2021. Published at the right-wing blog Federalist, the article alleges that the 2020 election was “bought by Mark Zuckerberg.” Its argument distills simply: Zuckerberg donated to an organization that worked to increase turnout, and that turnout altered the election results.“Interesting article,” Musk said of the 18-month-old piece. “Perhaps CommunityNotes” — Twitter’s crowdsourced notation system — “can add further context & corrections.”This is a common way in which Musk elevates right-wing rhetoric. He’ll often engage with fringe voices by declaring their commentary to be “concerning” — suggesting it’s just something worth mulling over. Here, Musk is suggesting that this heavily adjudicated assertion somehow demands new attention.So let’s give it that attention.CTCL did receive money from Zuckerberg and did use that money as it gave grants to local elections offices aimed at making it easier for voters to vote. Facebook has engaged in efforts to increase turnout before, including using prompts on its own platform. Here, though, Facebook had no role; it was CTCL’s implementation of an effort to bolster election systems aided by Zuckerberg’s personal money.Much of the analysis in the Federalist article centers on the idea that these investments were larger in more-Democratic counties, using that as a peg for the argument that the investments were partisan and critical to Biden’s success.But that argument is easily countered. CTCL’s investments were often in heavily Democratic areas — because those areas often have lower turnout rates. If you want to increase turnout, the smartest place to try to do so is places where turnout is lowest. In the United States, that’s often lower-income communities and communities that have high populations of Black and Hispanic residents, two groups that often vote heavily Democratic.It has long been the case that non-White Americans vote less heavily than Whites. The Washington Post looked at this issue last week, using data from the Census Bureau. If we cluster every county in the United States to one of 10 buckets (deciles), ranging from the lowest percentage of White residents to the highest, you see that less-White counties consistently have lower turnout than more-White ones.In 2018, the number of votes cast in the most heavily White decile of counties averaged about 52 percent of the voting-age population of citizens in the county. (This is admittedly an imperfect metric, including some people who are otherwise ineligible to vote.) In 2016, a presidential election year, the average in America’s least-White counties was only 53 percent. Even in a higher-turnout election, the least-White counties only turnout at about the same rate as the most-White ones did in a midterm.In 2016, the tenth of counties with the lowest turnout (relative to the citizen voting-age population) was an average of 60 percent White. The tenth with the highest turnout was 80 percent White.The higher the percentage of White people in a county, the higher the margin by which Trump won in 2020. Less-White often means more Democratic.Importantly, those less-White counties are also more populous. On average, the gap between the size of the citizen-age population in 2020 and the votes cast for president was an average of nearly 90,000 in the least-White counties in the United States. In the most-White counties, the average was under 5,000.Importantly, there isn’t a strong correlation between the turnout rate of a county in 2016 and how it voted. But the 16 counties that were in both the lowest turnout and highest population deciles (counties where 3.2 million votes were cast in 2020) were on average only 32 percent White. In the 43 counties where turnout was in the lowest decile and the population was in the second-lowest, an average of 60 percent of the population was White, but only 110,000 votes were cast. Targeting larger counties — and therefore getting more bang for your buck — means targeting counties with more non-White and more Democratic voters.It’s worth stepping back for a moment and considering the argument Musk is elevating even on its own terms. The charge is that, by donating to CTCL, Zuckerberg “bought” the election. But even if CTCL and Zuckerberg were explicitly donating only to Democratic areas to turnout only Democratic voters, none of which is true … all they stand accused of is getting more eligible voters to vote.As I wrote in July, the system as currently constituted makes it harder for young and poor people to vote: they move more often (meaning having to update registration information) and work less regular hours. It’s much easier to vote all the time if you’re a retiree that’s lived in the same place for 40 years. Since younger and poorer Americans are more likely to be non-White and more likely to be Democrats, the advantages some voters enjoy in the current system skew older, Whiter and Republican. If it was as easy for non-White and younger voters to vote as it is for older, Whiter ones, that would be a leveling of the playing field, not a skewing of it.This is the argument that Musk asks us to consider. With rhetoric cobbled together to more easily defend Trump’s “stolen election” claims, the argument is that efforts to target low-turnout communities are centrally an effort to get more Democrats to vote — and therefore nefarious, even though it amounts to nothing more than allowing more eligible voters to vote.Considered and rejected, Mr. Musk.

      "title": "Analysis | A brief timeline of Clarence Thomas’s ethics questions",
      "text": "This post has been updated.Yet more reporting Thursday highlighted growing ethics issues surrounding Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas: ProPublica reported on another previously undisclosed benefit Thomas received from billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow, and The Washington Post reported that a key Thomas ally sought to hide payments to Thomas’s wife.ProPublica reported that Crow paid $6,200 in monthly private boarding school tuition for Thomas’s grandnephew, whom Thomas had custody of since the child was 6 and raised as a son. While the total amount isn’t clear, it calculated it could be more than $150,000.A friend of Thomas’s, Mark Paoletta, said in a statement Thursday that Thomas didn’t have to disclose the tuition because Thomas’s grandnephew didn’t meet the relevant ethics law’s definition of “dependent child.” ProPublica cited experts who said the payments should have been disclosed because they were essentially gifts to Thomas.Regardless, this disclosure adds to a growing tab of Thomas-related spending by Crow that stretches into the millions. Crow has reportedly spent money on numerous luxury trips for Thomas, on Thomas’s wife’s political group, on Thomas’s mother’s house, on his grandnephew’s boarding school, and on library and museum projects around where Thomas grew up. In each case, these things were obscured before someone unearthed them.What the new reporting also adds is another example of something Thomas once disclosed but then decided not to — even as questions about his disclosures have followed him for years.Then, late Thursday, The Post reported that prominent conservative judicial activist and Thomas family ally Leonard Leo in 2012 directed that Thomas’s wife, conservative activist Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, be paid $25,000 but that the paperwork should have “No mention of Ginni, of course.” The money was billed to a nonprofit Leo advised, which that year filed a brief to the Supreme Court, raising questions about whether a potential conflict of interest was deliberately hidden.It’s a lot to sort through, and the timeline is important. Below is what we know so far about not just these matters, but other ethics questions that have followed Thomas.1991: Thomas is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice after contentious hearings featuring allegations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill.1996: Crow meets Thomas for the first time in Washington and invites him on a private flight back to Dallas, according to a recent interview given by Crow. (Thomas was due to speak at an event in the area.) The two men bonded on the plane, Crow said.1997: Thomas flies on Crow’s private jet to the Bohemian Grove in Monte Rio, Calif., an exclusive all-male retreat. Thomas discloses the trip.2001: Thomas accepts a gift from Crow of Frederick Douglass’s Bible, valued at $19,000. He also receives a $15,000 bust of Abraham Lincoln from the American Enterprise Institute, where Crow serves as a trustee. Thomas again discloses both.That same year, Crow donates $175,000 to a library in Savannah, Ga., for a project built in honor of Thomas. Crow initially wants the library renamed for Thomas, but settles for naming a wing after him. The gift is initially anonymous, but it is later made public amid an outcry by Black leaders who criticized Thomas.While speaking about his effort to gain custody of his grandnephew, Thomas becomes emotional. “The job is not worth doing for what they pay,” he says. “The job is not worth doing for the grief. But it is worth doing for the principle.”2002: Thomas discloses $5,000 that two friends, Earl and Louise Dixon, paid for his grandnephew’s education.2004: The Los Angeles Times reports on the pricey gifts and private travel from Crow, citing Thomas’s disclosures. In the years that followed, Thomas would continue to accept Crow’s largesse, but he would stop disclosing it, except for one gift in 2015.2008: Thomas begins sending his grandnephew to Hidden Lake Academy, a private boarding school in Georgia. Records from 2009 show Crow paid his $6,200 monthly tuition. A former administrator later told ProPublica that Crow paid for tuition for the grandnephew’s entire year-long stay at the school, and that Crow said he paid for tuition at a different boarding school both before and after Hidden Lake. If true, it could have cost more than $150,000 over four years, ProPublica reported. Despite disclosing the earlier education gift from friends, Thomas doesn’t disclose these.Crow purchases a seafood cannery in Thomas’s hometown of Pin Point, Ga., ultimately spending millions on a project to restore it and add a heritage museum. The New York Times later reports this was a “pet project” of Thomas’s, and that Thomas connected Crow to the cannery’s owner. The purchase remains murky until the 2011 Times piece, with the former owner saying he was told not to identify Crow as the purchaser.2009: Crow reportedly gives $500,000 to a conservative political nonprofit started by Ginni Thomas, called Liberty Central. The gift is initially anonymous, but Politico ties it to Crow in 2011. Ginni Thomas drew $120,000 in salary from the group in 2010.January 2010: A 5-4 Supreme Court majority, including Thomas, strikes down long-standing campaign finance restrictions in the landmark Citizens United v. FEC case. The decision allows unlimited spending by outside groups. Ginni Thomas soon says Liberty Central will accept corporate contributions.October-November 2010: Shortly after a New York Times story mentioning Liberty Central amid potential conflicts of interest with her husband, Ginni Thomas leaves the group, which cited “distractions.”January 2011: The watchdog group Common Cause argues that Justice Thomas should have recused himself from Citizens United, in part because of his wife’s potential benefit.Thomas amends financial disclosure reports for the previous 13 years, after the same watchdog notes that he had failed to disclose his wife’s employers. Thomas says the information was “inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions.”June 2011: The New York Times again details Crow’s lavish, Thomas-related spending and gifts, focusing on the museum. It notes Thomas has not disclosed any benefits from Crow since 2004, but that travel records for Crow’s planes and yachts indicate Thomas “may have used them in recent years.”October 2011: Thomas attends the dedication of the museum, calling Crow a “good man” while acknowledging Crow’s motives have been questioned.January 2012: Leo, a co-founder of Liberty Central with Ginni Thomas, instructs Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway to bill a nonprofit group he advises and “give” Ginni Thomas “another $25K.” He says the paperwork should include “No mention of Ginni, of course.” Later that same year, the nonprofit, the Judicial Education Project, would file a brief with the Supreme Court in a landmark case, Shelby County v. Holder. Justice Thomas would side with the Judicial Education Project’s position in a 5-4 decision. (Part of Thomas’s defense in the case of Crow’s largesse has been that Crow didn’t have direct business before the court.)2014: Thomas sells three pieces of property he co-owns to Crow, including his mother’s house. Despite the law making pretty clear that such real estate sales must be disclosed, Thomas doesn’t do so. Thomas’s mother reportedly still lives in the home Crow now owns.2015: Thomas discloses a gift from Crow — a $6,484.12 bust of Douglass.2018: Crow donates $105,000 to Yale Law School for a portrait of Thomas.June 2019 (and surrounding years): Thomas accepts a trip to Malaysia including private airfare and a superyacht from Crow, which ProPublica later values at more than $500,000. It is one of many luxury trips Thomas accepted from Crow “virtually every year,” the outlet recently reported. Thomas does not disclose these trips, as he did the 1997 trip to the Bohemian Grove.November 2020-January 2021: Ginni Thomas exchanges text messages with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, strategizing about efforts to overturn Trump’s election loss. In the texts, she mentions outreach to “Jared,” potentially fellow White House official and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. She also attends a “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.December 2021: Ginni Thomas signs a public letter sharply criticizing the Jan. 6 committee.January 2022: Justice Thomas provides the only dissenting voice as the Supreme Court grants the Jan. 6 committee access to Trump White House records. When details of Ginni Thomas’s post-2020 work with the White House come to light, some experts argue he should have recused himself from such Jan. 6-related cases. While the Meadows texts were turned over separately from the court’s decision, the experts say it raises the prospect of Justice Thomas potentially voting to shield his own wife’s communications with the White House and to protect her allies in efforts to overturn the election.",

      "title": "Carl Hagelin, still recovering from injuries, isn’t ready to walk away",
      "text": "After he packed his gear and said goodbye to his Capitals teammates at Washington’s practice facility earlier this month,  Carl Hagelin emerged from the dressing room and leaned against a wall near the rink.The Capitals’ veterans were giving interviews at a podium behind the team’s bench, but Hagelin talked in front of a few cameras off to the side. He had been driven to the shadows by four surgeries in the past year, including an operation that restitched the pupil in his left eye and another that resurfaced his damaged right hip. There were reminders of his injuries everywhere, even on breakdown day, where he glanced out at the rink.“I haven’t been on the ice yet,” he said, “but I'm thinking by the time July comes around, I want to skate really hard.”Hagelin eventually nodded up at the industrial fluorescent lights that hung above him.“It kind of messes the eye up a little bit,” he said, “but with a tinted visor, it feels a lot better.”He remains almost defiantly positive in his outlook, refusing to listen to those who expected him to give up the game after suffering his catastrophic injuries over the past 13 months. Hagelin has instead been emboldened after doctors were able to save his right eye and after watching Nicklas Backstrom become one of the rare professional athletes to return from a hip resurfacing this past season.Hagelin has already built a respectable NHL career: the 34-year-old was once among the league’s fastest skaters, logged more than 700 games in 11 seasons and won two Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Returning to the NHL with a permanently damaged eye and a metal hip would perhaps be his greatest accomplishment.“My goal is to play again,” Hagelin said. “My hip needs to feel good though, to do it. It kind of comes back to that. I need to get two and a half really good months on the ice skating … and at that point, if it feels good, I want to play in the NHL again.”Hagelin hasn’t played in a game since he suffered his eye injury while battling for a puck during a practice in March 2022. A stick whacked him in the face and ruptured the choroid in the back of his left eye.In the days after, doctors wondered if they would have to remove it; they eventually salvaged the eye by restitching the pupil. He only regained partial vision in that eye. It no longer dilates, and Hagelin struggled with depth perception early in his rehabilitation. He started to work with Keith Smithson, an optometrist based in Reston, Va., who has helped Washington Nationals pitchers, to recalibrate his brain and learn how to compensate with the limitations of his vision. Even though he wasn’t cleared by the team, he returned day after day for rehabilitation, clawing for progress.“He’s been in a tough position almost a year and a half,” captain Alex Ovechkin said, “but I never saw a guy who was [so] passionate about hockey. He came here every day working hard, give us the positive emotions.”That would have been enough to jeopardize any NHL player’s future, but Hagelin was also dealing with perpetual pain from his hip, an ailment he first started feeling in 2020. Even as he recovered from his eye injury, he returned to training camp last year and felt discomfort in his hip. “Like I had a knife going into my groin,” said Hagelin, who eventually underwent hip arthroscopy last September. “I think when I had the scope right away, they knew it wasn’t a home run. My hip was really messed up.”When that procedure didn’t get him back on the ice, he chose to do what his teammate and fellow Swedish countryman Backstrom had done the year before — he got his hip resurfaced. Hagelin knew it would further jeopardize any chance at a return, but he was encouraged not only by Backstrom’s return from the operation but by others in the sports world who had done the same, including tennis star Andy Murray.“It was interesting to watch the Andy Murray documentary, he’s back playing, running side to side aside looking pretty good. And then Backy obviously getting 40 games this year … I think players are ready and athletes are ready to put in the time nowadays to really get back at it,” Hagelin said. “I think it’s more that you’re at a point in your life where, when you’re older, some people just say, ‘Hey, it’s time to give up at this point.’ But obviously Backy is a great example.”Said Backstrom: “He is one of those guys that works hard and is eager to get back out there.”To do it, Hagelin will need to string together a few months of solid skating this summer before he regains his strength. “I need to get two and a half really good months on the ice skating,” he said, and once that happens, he will sit down with his agent and see what his options are.He’s clearly antsy to get back on the ice. Hagelin took part in the team’s official photo this month, getting dressed in his uniform for the first time all season. When the session was over and his teammates left the ice to get ready for practice, Hagelin remained by himself, taking a little twirl on his skates. It was the first time he had been on the ice since his hip surgery.“I think I’ve always kind of lived in the moment. You know, bad things happen. I’m fortunate to be playing this sport,” he said. “I’ve always been positive, and kind of see the bright side of things.”",

      "title": "Lost woman survives 5 days in the wild on a bottle of wine",
      "text": "A woman has survived five days stranded without water in the Australian wilderness, resorting to drinking the only liquid refreshment she had on her: a bottle of wine.Lillian Ip had set out on a vacation to Bright, at the base of the Victorian Alps. But when the 48-year-old failed to check in with relatives on April 30, local police said her family raised the alarm.Rescue authorities scoured the remote, hilly terrain around 270 miles northeast of the Victorian state capital, Melbourne, for days. Her car was finally spotted at the end of a dirt road by a police helicopter Friday.Ip doesn’t drink, but she told police she had a bottle of wine in her car that was intended as a gift for her mother.“That got her through,” Wodonga Police Station Sgt. Martin Torpey said in a statement. “She used great common sense to stay with her car and not wander off into bushland, which assisted in police being able to find her.”He said Ip was planning on taking a short day trip to a nearby dam, and had only a couple of snacks and some candy with her, but no water.When she hit a dead end in the road, she realized she had taken a wrong turn. She attempted to turn her car around and retrace her route, but it became stuck in the muddy track. Her cellphone was out of range, making it impossible to call for help.Aerial footage taken by police shows the moment she was spotted by rescue helicopter — waving her arms on a narrow dirt trail, surrounded by towering trees.See the moment Air Wing located a woman, who was missing for five days in dense bushland.Yesterday afternoon, Air Wing were conducting a sweep of the hilly terrain when they spotted Lillian’s car at the end of a dirt road in the Mitta Mitta bushland.🔗 https://t.co/dgjOkkgdY0 pic.twitter.com/DwbaJHLUMn“I thought I was going to die there. My whole body shut down on Friday,” Ip told Australia’s Nine News network. The day before, she had apparently penned a farewell note to her family. When officers arrived on the scene in a police van, her first request was simple: “Water and a cigarette,” she said.Ip isn’t the first person to be stranded and forced to survive on an unconventional diet. A sailor from Dominica made it through 24 days adrift at sea with little more than a bottle of ketchup to sustain him. (Heinz later tracked him down and gave him a new boat.) And when two women vanished for four days in Maine’s icy wilderness, all they had left when rescuers arrived was a half-empty bottle of Mountain Dew, frozen solid, The Post reported.Heinz found the ‘ketchup boat guy’ after an international searchAdvice from the U.S. government on preparing for emergencies suggests people require at least one gallon of water per day, along with a solid supply of nonperishable food. Wine — a known diuretic that removes water from the body and can cause dehydration, according to health experts — doesn’t make the survival-kit list.Ip was taken to hospital for observation, where she was treated for dehydration and later released, according to police.The area where she became lost is popular with four-wheel drivers. Guide maps label the roads near where her car became stuck as remote and potentially steep and slippery — suitable for experienced drivers. Yankee Point Track, where her car became bogged, is marked as a “bush track.”While she couldn’t move her car, she was able to use the heater to stay warm during the cool nights of the southern hemisphere fall, police said.“After being lost in the bush for five days, she was extremely relieved and grateful to see us, and we were just as happy to see her,” Torpey said.",

      "title": "Analysis | Where Supreme Court’s Clarence Thomas Ethics Accusations Might Lead",
      "text": "US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is under scrutiny for his acceptance of financial largesse from Texas billionaire Harlan Crow, following reports that he didn’t disclose tuition payments for his grandnephew’s private school, a property sale or lavish trips, all provided by Crow, a Republican donor. The Supreme Court sets its own rules as a co-equal branch of government and has no code of conduct, but ethics laws and rules that apply widely to the judiciary require the disclosure of gifts. The court’s constitutional independence means there’s little chance that Thomas will be sanctioned. Thomas’s defenders said the gifts didn’t need to be disclosed.1. What are the accusations against Clarence Thomas?Thomas’s ties to Crow were the subject of revelations reported by ProPublica. Among its findings were that Crow paid for at least a part of the private school tuition for Thomas’s grandnephew, who was raised by Thomas and his wife, Ginni. Crow also bought from Thomas’s family the Georgia home that Thomas’s mother lived in, and then spent tens of thousands of dollars making improvements to it. And Crow paid for lavish trips taken by Clarence and Ginni Thomas, using Crow’s private jet. After the trips were reported, Thomas said he was advised that he didn’t have to report “this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends.” He added that Crow hadn’t had any business before the Supreme Court, though Bloomberg News later reported that the court in 2005 had denied to hear an appeal from a company that had sued a Crow-affiliated business. Thomas has said he intends to follow the Judicial Conference’s gift reporting guidelines in the future. 2. What ethical rules apply to Supreme Court justices?Each branch of the US government is responsible for policing its own ethics, with some exceptions. The executive branch, which includes the White House, is subject to the Office of Government Ethics, whose director is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. In the legislative branch, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have ethics committees that consider alleged violations by members. In the judicial branch, judges in federal district, appellate and bankruptcy courts have been guided by a code of conduct since the 1970s. But the Supreme Court isn’t subject to it. In his 2011 annual report on the judiciary, Chief Justice John Roberts said that the justices consult the lower courts’ code of conduct but that the Supreme Court had “no reason to adopt the Code of Conduct as its definitive source of ethical guidance.” Justice Elena Kagan said at a 2019 House hearing that a code specific to the Supreme Court was being “very seriously” considered. But no code has been proposed or implemented.3. Could Congress do anything?Theoretically, yes. The US Constitution gives Congress the power to impeach and remove a Supreme Court justice for bad conduct using the same process — charged by the House, tried by the Senate — that applies to US presidents. The only justice to have been impeached was Samuel Chase in 1804. He was accused of mishandling politically sensitive cases and charged by the House, but the Senate acquitted him after a trial. There’s almost no chance that today’s House would impeach Thomas: It’s controlled by Republicans, many of whom spoke out in defense of Thomas. On the legislative side, Democratic members of Congress have introduced a measure that would require the federal courts’ policy making body to enact a code of conduct that applies to the Supreme Court as well as to lower courts. Whether any such legislation would be constitutional isn’t clear, because any attempt by Congress to regulate the Supreme Court could be seen as violating the doctrine of separation of powers. 4. Could anyone else do anything?There may be enough evidence for the Justice Department to launch an investigation into whether Thomas violated financial disclosure laws. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 authorizes the attorney general to pursue civil enforcement actions, something the Justice Department has done in the past in cases where other officials violated their obligation to accurately disclose their finances, said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University in St. Louis School of Law professor who served as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991. Violators can face civil penalties as high as $50,000 per violation. In April, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, asked the Judicial Conference in a letter to refer Thomas to the attorney general. The conference said it forwarded Whitehouse’s letter to its Committee on Financial Disclosure, which is responsible for implementing the law’s disclosure provisions and addressing allegations of errors or omissions in the filing of financial disclosure reports.5. Any chance he’ll choose to resign?There is precedent for such a turn of events. In 1969, Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas resigned under the threat of impeachment after a magazine reported he accepted a $20,000 fee (equal to about $170,000 today) by the family foundation of a man being investigated for stock manipulation — returning it only after the man’s indictment. Fortas denied any wrongdoing but became the first and only justice to resign rather than face impeachment. The same fate isn’t likely for Thomas, 74, considering that all nine justices implicitly backed him in a letter Roberts wrote to the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that defended the court’s ethical standards.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "title": "Myisha Hines-Allen is back on the court after surgery and frustration",
      "text": "Myisha Hines-Allen was back on the basketball court about two months ago and feeling pretty good about herself. She had returned after September surgery to repair the patellar tendon in her left knee and was getting the chance to run and jump for the first time. It was a good day considering recovery had been much slower than the original three-to-four month timeline.The following day wasn’t so good as the Mystics forward couldn’t even complete certain exercises.“Then I go on the court and it was absolutely bad,” Hines-Allen said. “It was just like, what the [expletive]. … I’m thinking about how far behind I am. Why is this happening to me?”The Mystics don’t think the WNBA title chase is a two-team raceThose two days were the beginning of an attitude change for Hines-Allen, after a conversation with the team’s mental performance coach Stu Singer. She came away from the conversation with a new catchphrase: Accept all days. There were going to be good days and bad ones, steps forward and backward during the entire process and the fifth-year veteran needed to understand that and give herself the grace to accept the challenging ones. The bottom line: There are no bad days as long as she gives 100 percent of what her body will allow on any given day.“Ultimately, you win the day that way,” Hines-Allen said. “The mind-set for me now is like, you’re going to hit a wall. It is what it is.”Hines-Allen reached another milestone this week, playing five-on-five at practice Sunday for the first time. She’s now fully participating in practice, though the team is slowly working her back in and is being careful with her conditioning. Coach Eric Thibault said she’s “definitely” turned a corner the last couple weeks, but there’s still no time frame for her return with the season opener against the New York Liberty on May 19. One thing that remains problematic is Hines-Allen suffered nerve damage which caused the loss of some feeling in her left leg. That’s getting better, but has yet to be completely resolved.But, overall, Hines-Allen is on the backside of rehab and can start to focus on her role and on-court productivity. The knee injury has been lingering since 2021 and she admitted playing that offseason in Italy made things worse. That played a role in Hines-Allen having her worst statistical season since 2019, when she averaged just 7.8 minutes per game. Another challenge was having Elena Delle Donne back in the lineup regularly for the first time since 2019, and the drafting of Shakira Austin with the No. 3 overall pick. Delle Donne had a strict load-management schedule and Hines-Allen was considered the starter the games Delle Donne sat. So Hines-Allen’s role could change almost game-to-game and there was also the adjustment of playing besides a true center in Austin.“We talked to her in exit interviews and through the offseason about we can help you, but part of being a big-time player is being able to adapt to your situation,” Thibault said. “It’s part of her maturation as a player. … No matter who you’re playing with, you can defend and rebound. And not worry so much about your offense and where your offense is coming from. I think she’s in a better head space now.”Hines-Allen said she’s going back to what made her a success in the first place — rebounding, setting good screens and using her passing ability. She wants to do those three things every time she steps on the court and believes that will alleviate some of the pressure she puts on herself.It can be hard to imagine Hines-Allen struggling mentally considering her overtly outgoing and bubbly personality. She’s quick with a smile and seems to befriend everyone in her orbit. Rehab, however, weighed heavy. Part of getting back into a good mental place was the execution of her podcast “Offline” with Mystics practice player Greg Cross.“She’s definitely a free thinker,” Cross said with a laugh. “This is an opportunity for us to give a voice to women that haven’t had a voice before and be able to have a creative platform for them to share their stories. She’s very creative. Tons of fun.”Hines-Allen added, “That’s why I needed to podcast because I would have been going crazy.”Is D.C. crime bad enough to bring the Guardian Angels back? They think so.Now Hines-Allen plans to get back to herself on the court, too. She was named all-WNBA second team in 2020 after averaging career highs in points (17.0), rebounds (8.9), assists (2.6), steals (1.5), field goal percentage (51.0) and three-point percentage (42.6).“As time went along, she was able to be like, okay, this is what this is and I’m going to handle it accordingly and move accordingly,” Ariel Atkins said. “That was really dope for me to hear that because I know a year ago, even two, three years ago, that wasn’t something that she was able to do. She would try to impose her will. For her to be able to grow in that aspect of mentality, I think is amazing for her and is going to help her so much further than just this year alone.”Hines-Allen added, “If we’re being honest, I’m not supposed to be on this team and I wasn’t supposed to be in this league for this long. So this is just like, all right, what got you here? Go back to your basics.”",

      "text": "As the NFL moves toward possible preliminary approval of Josh Harris’s tentative $6.05 billion deal to purchase the Washington Commanders from Daniel Snyder, more of the investors in Harris’s group are becoming publicly known.Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive officer of Google; Alejandro Santo Domingo, a senior managing director of New York investment firm Quadrant Capital Advisors, Inc. and a billionaire heir to a family beer fortune; and Mitchell Morgan, the founder and CEO of Pennsylvania-based Morgan Properties, are limited partners in the group, a person familiar with the situation confirmed.They join previously known investors Mitchell Rales, the co-founder of the Danaher Corporation, and former NBA great Earvin “Magic” Johnson.NFL is talking with Daniel Snyder reps; sale approval could come in stagesHarris is the owner of the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils. The Commanders’ sale price would set a record for an NFL franchise, surpassing the $4.65 billion a group led by Walmart heir Rob Walton paid last year to buy the Denver Broncos from the Pat Bowlen Trust.Schmidt’s inclusion, in particular, adds financial strength to the group. He is the world’s 92nd-wealthiest individual, according to Forbes, with an estimated net worth of $18.1 billion. Schmidt served as Google’s CEO from 2001 to 2011, after which he became the company’s executive chairman until 2018. He left the board of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, in 2019.Bloomberg first reported Schmidt’s involvement in the Harris group.Forbes estimates Santo Domingo’s net worth at $2.8 billion. Santo Domingo sits on the board of Anheuser-Busch InBev and on the board of trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, according to Forbes. His family’s estimated net worth of $12.1 billion makes it Colombia’s richest family, according to Bloomberg.Santo Domingo is married to Lady Charlotte Wellesley, the daughter of the Duke of Wellington. Spain’s former king, Juan Carlos I, attended their 2016 wedding in Spain. Santo Domingo’s niece, Tatiana Santo Domingo, is married to Andrea Casiraghi of Monaco, the grandson of Grace Kelly.Santo Domingo did not respond to a request for comment.

      "title": "Feinstein returning to Washington after extended health-related absence",
      "text": "Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is returning to Washington on Tuesday afternoon and could head to the U.S. Capitol as early as Tuesday evening, after a more-than-two-month health-related absence from the Senate.Feinstein’s imminent return was confirmed by her spokesman, Adam Russell. It is unclear when she will be at the Capitol.Feinstein, who at 89 is the oldest member of the Senate, has been absent since February after she was hospitalized with a case of shingles, complicating things for Senate Democrats and their narrow majority.“I’m glad that my friend Dianne is back in the Senate and ready to roll up her sleeves and get to work,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. “After talking with her multiple times over the past few weeks, it’s clear she’s back where she wants to be and ready to deliver for California.”Feinstein initially said in a statement that she hoped to return in late March after receiving treatment for shingles in San Francisco. As the weeks wore on with no return, however, a handful of congressional Democrats began calling for Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to resign from the Senate.Her absence has stalled confirmations of some of President Biden’s judicial nominees, given that only judges with some Republican support can move to the floor without her tiebreaking vote on the committee. Her vote could also be crucial in negotiations over lifting the debt ceiling.Feinstein’s absence also proved a challenge for Senate Judiciary Chair Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) as he tried to bring more scrutiny to Supreme Court ethics reform in the wake of reports that Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose gifts from billionaire GOP donor Harlan Crow.“It’s very difficult to chart a course in an evenly divided committee in those circumstances,” Durbin said last week.With Feinstein’s return, Durbin has the votes to pass legislation through his committee and to issue a subpoena, which he’s said he is considering in the case of Crow.At one point, Feinstein asked Schumer to temporarily replace her on the committee while she continued to “work from home” and recover from shingles. Senate Republicans blocked the move last month.Feinstein’s allies, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), pushed back on the calls for her to retire and suggested they saw a sexist double standard in how Feinstein’s absence was treated compared to those of male senators. In recent months, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) were out for weeks for medical reasons.Though Feinstein has waved off questions about her age and ability to serve, she has also relinquished key roles in recent years. She stepped down as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee before the 117th Congress, when she would have been the first woman to lead that committee. And last year, Feinstein declined consideration to become president pro tempore of the Senate, the position third in line to the presidency that traditionally goes to the most senior senator of the party in power. The role instead went to Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).Feinstein also announced earlier this year that she would not seek reelection in 2024, kicking off a competition among Democratic Reps. Adam B. Schiff, Barbara Lee and Katie Porter for her seat.",

      "title": "Analysis | How Japan’s Leader Got His Groove Back",
      "text": "It turns out it might be worth remembering his name after all.The international scorn over how rapidly Japan changes leaders had led some to wonder if it was worth even bothering to take note of Fumio Kishida. After all, his predecessor lasted less than year in the job.Kishida’s premiership started positively enough in late 2021. But it all began to unravel when political opponents and the media seized on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s ties to the Unification Church following the killing of former leader Shinzo Abe last July. The story dominated the headlines and sidelined Kishida’s agenda for months, sending his approval ratings into a tailspin, despite his lack of personal involvement. Insiders openly questioned whether the prime minister was actually interested in remaining in power, having seemingly done little to play the game of thrones. But in recent months, something unusual seems to be happening in Japanese politics: a comeback story. Having weathered the scandal and polling ratings that typically bring the knives out for unpopular LDP leaders, Kishida has re-emerged with a flurry of diplomatic activity that has him back in control. His support rate has recovered to the levels before Abe’s killing, while a stronger-than-expected performance in by-elections last month bolstered his internal support. Talk that next week’s Group of Seven summit would be his swansong has now turned instead to the possibility he could capitalize on a successful meeting by calling a snap election shortly afterward. He’s taken a page or two out of Abe’s playbook. The late leader became a master of sticking it out through scandals, relying on internal support — and a lack of alternatives — to wait until the media ran out of material. While Kishida doesn’t have Abe’s control of the party, he’s been aided by the fact that the Abe faction, the LDP’s largest grouping, remains in disarray and has yet to choose a new leader. Fortune has favored him in other ways. Kishida’s strengths lie in international diplomacy, and he took power in a post-Covid world at a time when he could shine. A visit to Kyiv in March contrasted well with Xi Jinping meeting Vladimir Putin at the same time. This month, he courted the Global South with a multi-stage visit to Africa, the first for a Japanese leader for nearly a decade. Thanks largely to the Biden administration’s increasingly tough stance on China, Tokyo is gaining global relevance as Washington seeks allies to contain Beijing’s rise — a multi-pronged strategy espoused by Abe. US pressure was also a likely factor in the outreach from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought to repair ties strained for years. That’s enabled Kishida to get good press hosting his counterpart in Tokyo and, in a quick turnaround, reciprocating that visit this week in Seoul. After Yoon’s trip to Washington last month, President Joe Biden can paint a picture of an alliance on China’s doorstep, one in which Japan features front and center. That Kishida, in effect, let Seoul blink first in seeking to mend relations also helps at home, where the public is weary of demands for wartime apologies. Domestically, things are going Kishida’s way, too. On Monday, the country drew a line under the pandemic by downgrading coronavirus to the same status as seasonal influenza, ending most Covid-era measures. The return of throngs of foreign tourists will help boost parts of the economy and stabilize the yen, contributing to a sense of an economic pickup even if its actual impact is limited. The premier’s quick return to the campaign trail last month following a failed assassination attempt made him look like leadership material. The left-field choice of governor for the Bank of Japan — one that, if mishandled, had potential to roil the economy — has so far paid off, with Kazuo Ueda toeing the line on easy money. People like leaders when they’re seen to do something. After a year squandered on his fuzzy and ill-thought-out “New Capitalism” economic measures, Kishida’s decision to increase spending to boost defense and combat the falling birthrate seems to have hit home — even if he hasn’t yet outlined the details or, more importantly, where the money will come from. As discussions around those plans advance, the harsh reality that they’ll likely involve higher taxes might weigh on his popularity. That gives the prime minister a window to call for a snap election, even though a vote isn’t required until 2025. Japanese leaders typically choose the most politically convenient time to refresh their mandate, and after Biden and other world leaders assemble in Kishida’s native constituency of Hiroshima next week, speculation is rife that he may do just that. A strong performance would pave the way for him to walk through next year’s leadership race for the ruling party and set him up to become become one of the country’s longest-serving leaders of recent decades. Kishida has denied he’s considering dissolving parliament, though such assurances are worth little. What might be more useful in evaluating his options is the fate of his predecessor, Yoshihide Suga. He, too, had a chance to call an election after replacing Abe, with his popularity high and Covid at the time largely contained. He demurred, and the moment never returned. Despite his accomplishments in office, many didn’t stop to remember Suga’s name. The incumbent can still avoid that fate. More From Bloomberg Opinion:• Tokyo-Seoul Accord Must Not Be Another False Dawn: Gearoid Reidy• Japan Is Part of the Alliance of 5 to Contain China: Hal Brands• Japan’s Standing Is Rising.

      "title": "Analysis | The age at which people give up on homeownership, and more!",
      "text": "When do people stop owning a home? Thus asks J.D. Zahniser of St. Paul, Minn., who specifically wants to know at what age homeownership starts to drop in the United States, and whether it varies by income, education and race. She also wonders if state of residence matters: Do more people in Northern states give up on winter and move?Brilliant question! We’ve often looked at when homeownership begins, but rarely when it ends.In America, most people don’t become homeowners until age 35. By the time we hit our 70s, about 80 percent of households own their own home, according to our analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Homeownership remains steady throughout most of our 70s, dropping only as we near 80. (We’re focusing on households and the demographics of householders to avoid counting as homeowners people such as adult children living at home or retired parents who live with a family member.)“When homeownership begins to fall is when retirees start seeing disabilities that will prevent them from living on their own,” economist Angie Chen at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College told us. “So they may be moving in with family or into an assisted-care facility.”Of course, that chart above includes households whose ownership is shared with a bank. Most of us don’t own our homes outright until after age 65, when the number of true homeowners finally passes the number of people writing mortgage checks.J.D. wrote that she herself is in the process of moving from her St. Paul home to a rental unit in the same city “despite this past looong and horrible winter.” As she correctly guessed, there’s a strong geographic element to when homeownership begins to fall.The colder it is, the earlier people give up their homes. In Northern states from Montana to Maine, homeownership peaks from 65 to 69, while in the Sun Belt it tends to peak from 75 to 79.We’re only comparing resident owners and renters here, so it’s not just that people are fleeing for warmer climes. When the Northerners drop out of one state in our measure, they are instead measured in their new state. This suggests that a substantial group — perhaps including some widows and widowers — sell their homes and move to local rental communities where somebody else is responsible for shoveling snow. It’s also likely that homeowners are better positioned than renters to cash out, sell their homes and high-tail it to the Sun Belt.J.D. asked whether education and race play a role in when you give up your house. The answer surprised us.Education and race determine how likely you are to own your home through much of your life, but age is the great equalizer. If we survive to age 90, we’re all about equally likely to have left our homes for rentals at all education levels, from high school dropouts to those with advanced degrees.While different groups have different ages at which homeownership peaks, that seems mostly to be determined by how high their rates of homeownership climbed before the gravity of age kicks in and homeownership begins its slow descent to around 64 percent at 90.Most racial groups show similar patterns, though BC’s Chen reminds us that survival bias may be at play here. Less-educated or Black Americans die earlier on average, and the lucky few who make it to age 90 may not be representative.And the national pattern doesn’t hold for all racial groups. Native and Asian Americans are outliers: Homeownership tends to drop at earlier ages for Asian Americans, while it barely drops for Natives.Tens of millions of overseas tourists flock to the United States each year, single-handedly keeping America’s purveyors of creepy plush toys afloat. Where do they — the tourists, not the creepy plush toys — come from?The pandemic scrambled everything you ever knew about overnight-visitor data from the National Travel and Tourism Office — which, if you’re reading this column, might be a surprising amount. (Overnight visitors include holders of business and student visas, but about 85 percent are tourists).For years, the highest share of tourists crossed the Atlantic from Europe, with arrivals from Asia ranking second. But during the pandemic, visits from Europe and Asia plummeted as travel restrictions swept the Eurasian supercontinent. For the first time on record, South America briefly became the top source of international visitors to the United States. It held that spot through most of 2021, before being overtaken by a reopening Europe.It’s unclear whether travel trends will ever return to what we still stubbornly insist on calling “normal.” Tourism from Asia has been particularly slow to recover, even as travelers from other continents appear to be rapidly rebooking their trips to New York, Miami and L.A.Only about 18 percent of tourists are currently arriving in the United States from Asia, down from about a third pre-pandemic. South Koreans, Japanese and Chinese are visiting at tiny fractions of the rates they did before the virus hit. Of Asia’s onetime tourist titans, only India has posted a near-complete recovery.Until shockingly recently, India didn’t even rank among the top 20 countries sending travelers to America. By 2020, when the novel coronavirus began its spittle-borne spread, India was on the verge of cracking the top 10. Now, with India poised to overtake China as the world’s most populous country, it has seized a spot among the top five or six sources of U.S. visitors. (Most Indian visitors are tourists, but like China, India also sends an unusually large share of students.)India is far from overtaking the true tourist leaders, however. Canada and Mexico have insurmountable leads, aided by 5,525 and 1,954 miles of America-front real estate, respectively. Our neighbors to the north have long held the top spot, though Mexico passed them during much of the pandemic. The United Kingdom, Germany and France round out the top five, though that could change as pandemic travel restrictions ease in East Asia.Those are national numbers. But the biggest source of tourists varies by state. Each global region has its own preferred set of U.S. destinations, with European, African and Middle Eastern tourists typically starting in New York, according to the I-94 forms on which visitors report their first destination on U.S. soil. Tourists from South and Central America and the Caribbean typically begin in Florida, while tourists from Asia and Oceania start in California.The U.K. leads in most states, but India is now the top source of tourists in most of the Midwest, according to the I-94 data. Japan leads in Hawaii, Colombia leads in Puerto Rico, and Germany and Italy have eked out leads in a few states in the Midwest and South.India’s prominence in heartland travel (including business and student visitors), like its high ranking in U.S. tourism overall, is a recent development. In 2019, before the novel coronavirus emerged from China and changed travel patterns from that people’s republic, perhaps permanently, China was the top supplier of travelers to many of America’s most populous states, including California, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Which profession dislikes its own clients or customers the most?

      "title": "Analysis | America’s friendliest big cities are not the ones you’d expect",
      "text": "At the risk of being pilloried as the Department of Crude Urban Stereotypes, we’ll admit we were astounded and confounded to read that one of our favorite federal data sets named Boston and Philadelphia as the most helpful major cities in America.A recent report found that the Northeastern duo — better known as places where people repeatedly punch police horses and sling racial slurs at athletes — have the highest “informal helping rate” among 12 large metros.The report relies upon the Current Population Survey, conducted by the Census Bureau. Every other year, on behalf of AmeriCorps, our friends at Census add a set of questions about volunteering and civic life to their superstar survey, which underlies such critical statistics as the nation’s unemployment rate.The question that drew us in, informal helping, asks how often in the past year you and your neighbors did “favors for each other such as house sitting, watching each other’s children, lending tools, and other things to help each other.”In 2021, Philadelphia and Boston led the pack. And it doesn’t appear to have been a fluke: On other measures of neighborliness — including joining organizations, volunteering and donating — the City of Brotherly Love and Beantown rank almost as high. When we looked at pre-pandemic data, from 2017 and 2019, they were also near the top of the listings.But 12 metros is a pretty limited universe. If we look at states, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts ranked in the middle of the pack on all four measures from 2017 to 2021. Most of the states that bested them on helpfulness do not have metros big enough to be included on the top-12 city list.If we squish the four horsemen of helpfulness — donating, joining, volunteering and doing favors for neighbors — into a rough index of civic-mindedness, Utah rises to the top. The Beehive State, which gets its nickname in part from the titular insects’ organization and cooperation, leads the nation in formal civic participation such as volunteering and membership in groups, organizations or associations.Minnesota ranks as the second-most-consistent standout, led by charitable giving so generous that it sustains the nation’s most robust classical music system. Nebraska and Oregon also do unusually well. Montana ties Utah as the most helpful state, but it doesn’t rank quite as high on other measures.As a rule, northern rural states excel by these metrics, while urbanized states in the southern half of the country struggle. Nevada, Florida and California settle to the bottom in just about any measure.If we apply what we learned from states back to cities and combine data from 2017 to 2021, we can expand our analysis to include rough-and-ready estimates of helpfulness in 88 metro areas. And all we can say is: Step aside, Philly and Boston. Because a single metropolitan statistical area leads in every category.(Here we’ll pause for dramatic effect. Also to wait for Bradley, a lifelong friend who, as he reads each column, texts us his guesses at the data mysteries therein. This one is tricky, but we have a feeling it’ll come naturally to Brad and any other Brigham Young University alumni in our readership.)The most civically minded metro in the United States is of course Provo, Utah!Strung along the Wasatch Range south of Salt Lake City, Provo ranks among the most-educated 10 percent of U.S. metros thanks in large part to BYU and the even larger Utah Valley University in nearby Orem, also part of the metro area. The next-highest-ranking metro, Portland, Maine, is also particularly well-educated, as is highly ranked Minneapolis. The other metros that do well based on our ad hoc index — Grand Rapids, Mich., Salisbury, Md., and Omaha — have lower education rates, but they’re still above average.So what predicts an area’s civic engagement? In general, it rises steadily with income and northerliness. But education is the big one: Having a graduate degree is the strongest signal you’ll be a major civic participant, with bachelor’s degrees not far behind. Other good indicators include a family income above $150,000, work in management or professional jobs, and work in the nonprofit sector.Blue-collar workers are less likely to be civically engaged, as are noncitizens and young people. Volunteering peaks in middle age — 45 to 54 — but most other measures of civic activity rise steadily as you get older and peak in your 70s.By many of these metrics, Philly and Boston rise above the 10 other large metros in the initial chart. They’re both in the top three for nonprofit and professional workers and for people in their 60s, three very engaged groups. They’re at the bottom for 16- and 17-year-olds, and for high school dropouts, two of the least-engaged groups.But the decisive factor, based on our analyses of all available metros and states, may be that, relative to other world-class American cities, greater Boston and Philadelphia just aren’t that diverse: They’re among the Whitest large Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the nation. (Keep in mind that metro areas include suburbs that are often Whiter than the cities they surround.)James Prieger of Pepperdine University finds that race strongly predicts civic engagement, even after controlling for education, income, citizenship and a host of other variables. In a 2013 California Journal of Politics and Policy paper with Kelly Faltis, then a Pepperdine graduate student, he laid out one possible explanation for the trend.“Hispanics or other minorities may be less civically engaged because they lack the necessary time, money, and civic skills inculcated by education that are more readily available to whites,” Prieger wrote.When we called Mike Hanmer, director of the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement at the University of Maryland, he was hardly surprised by our hard-won findings.“We’ve known this for a while,” he said (somewhat dispiritingly): Decades of research have shown that less-White places have lower civic participation.“It comes down to time, money and civic skills,” Hanmer told us. “And we know that those things are not evenly distributed throughout the population. … Systematically, certain groups — particularly members of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in our society — haven’t had the same access and the same opportunities.”In his previous career with the agency now known as AmeriCorps, Hanmer’s U-Md. colleague, Do Good Institute professor Nathan Dietz, helped write many of the original versions of the survey questions we used in this analysis.“When you try to measure participation rates for most civic activities, especially activities that happen through organizations, you usually see racial and ethnic gaps,” Dietz told us. “That tells me that there are structural reasons why some people are much more likely than others to get involved in these types of activities.”To understand those structural reasons, we continued our virtual tour of the Maryland campus, calling political scientist Janelle Wong. Wong’s work focuses on Asian Americans who, despite higher average incomes and education levels, are less civically engaged as a group than their White friends. Many of her findings apply to Hispanics as well.“Unlike other groups, Asian Americans are a majority immigrant group,” Wong told us. “So their exposure to the U.S. political system and experience is going to be lower. Once they have more years in the U.S. … they do participate at higher rates.”Wong points out that civic participation often isn’t driven by individuals pushing to get involved. It’s driven by institutions pulling individuals in. And while that has changed somewhat in recent years, some institutions still don’t recognize less-established groups such as Asian or Hispanic Americans as potential volunteers, donors and allies.Wendy K. Tam Cho of the University of Illinois is well-known among political nerds for her algorithms to expose (and fix) gerrymandering. But one of her first published papers tackled low civic participation and voting among immigrant communities.Writing in 1999, Cho said standard demographic variables aren’t enough to explain the gaps, in part because participation is driven by socialization and skills picked up in American primary and secondary schools, which we assume could include anything from a civics class to hosting bake sales to buy band uniforms.“For the native-born, past political experiences provide an understanding of American government, party politics, the voting process, etc.,” Cho wrote. “For the foreign-born, past experiences may not have provided the same familiarity.”So Whites don’t just engage at higher rates because they tend to have higher incomes or education levels than some of their peers. It’s because Italians and Irish and Germans have had generations to attend U.S. schools, which provide an important pathway into the American system of civic engagement.As your socioeconomic status rises, you find it easier to be active in your community.

      "text": "The Washington Commanders released veteran center Chase Roullier on Friday, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, concluding a months-long shift in the team’s interior offensive line. The Commanders designated Roullier as a post-June 1 release, allowing them to split his remaining prorated signing bonus that will count against their cap — known as dead money — over the final two seasons of his deal. Until June 1, the team will carry his full cap charge.His release will save the team $8.37 million in cap space in 2023, with $4.05 million in dead money counting against the cap in each of the next two seasons.A sixth-round pick out of Wyoming in 2017, Roullier quickly became the anchor of Washington’s offensive line. Late in the 2020 season, the Commanders signed him to a four-year, $40.5 million contract that made him one of the highest-paid centers in the NFL. But injuries derailed him over the past two seasons, and his exit seemed inevitable at the conclusion of the 2022 season.Breaking down the Commanders' 2023 draft classCoach Ron Rivera has emphasized the Commanders’ need to find stability on the interior of the offensive line, especially at center, where the team has been ravaged by injuries.“Unfortunately, the position that we’ve had a lot of injuries is center, and … we got to look at [it] and figure out how we can solidify that group and hopefully not have to go through that again,” Rivera said in January.In 2021 and 2022, Washington cycled through four starters at center because of injuries. Both Roullier and backup Tyler Larsen, who re-signed with the team in March, suffered season-ending injuries in consecutive years.A severe ankle injury ended Roullier’s 2021 campaign after only eight games. After undergoing surgery, he recovered, but in Week 2 last season, he suffered a knee injury that also required surgery.Now fully healthy, Roullier can sign with another team after June 1.Commanders are lobbying Congress over future of RFKThe Commanders, meanwhile, will turn to Nick Gates, a veteran they signed in free agency in March, along with Larsen and third-round rookie Ricky Stromberg. Though training camp and late roster additions could alter the plan, Gates figures to start at center, with Larsen and Stromberg as backups.Washington has long sought versatile players, especially up front. Gates can play guard and center, and another free agent addition, tackle Andrew Wylie, can also play inside at guard. The team also added tackle Trent Scott in free agency and selected tackle/guard Braeden Daniels in the fourth round of last week’s draft.",

      "title": "Jury rules for drugmaker, dealing blow to U.S. over HIV patent lawsuit",
      "text": "A federal jury rejected claims by the U.S. government that Gilead Sciences infringed on its patents for an anti-HIV regimen, giving the drugmaker a major win in a legal brawl that has stretched for more than three years.Jurors in the U.S. District Court in Delaware found in favor of California-based Gilead on all counts, according to a verdict sheet filed Tuesday.“We are pleased with today’s favorable jury verdict,” Deb Telman, Gilead’s general counsel, said in a statement. “The jury determined that Gilead has not infringed the U.S. government’s patents and that the patents are invalid.” The Justice Department declined to comment Tuesday.The verdict amounts to a big blow to the department, which sued Gilead in 2019 in one of its most muscular efforts in recent years to enforce its patent rights. The government accused Gilead of infringing on patents obtained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, raking in a multibillion-dollar windfall enabled by the agency’s pioneering research.Gilead, however, contended that the CDC’s patents were invalid and won a separate federal court ruling that the government breached contracts over research.The dispute goes back to the mid-2000s, when CDC scientists discovered that combining two drugs used to treat HIV could effectively prevent the spread of the virus that causes AIDS. The regimen is called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, and the CDC contends that its researchers paved the way for the approach at a time others were skeptical it could work.Gilead donated its drug, Truvada, to the CDC’s research at no cost. After results proved promising, the agency urged the company to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration to use Truvada for PrEP. The FDA granted that approval in 2012, partially relying on the CDC’s research, and the discovery kicked off a new use for Truvada.That collaboration frayed as the CDC tried to license its patents to Gilead, and the drugmaker balked. Gilead went on to make billions selling Truvada, and paid no royalties to the government.Gilead had previously challenged the CDC’s patents, but the Patent Trial and Appeal Board declined to review Gilead’s dispute in February 2020, saying it hadn’t shown a “reasonable likelihood of prevailing.”The jury in Delaware federal court, however, found that specific claims in three patents at issue were invalid because they could have been anticipated or were obvious, according to the verdict sheet.Organizations advocating for expanding access to PrEP had closely followed the litigation, hoping that a government victory could create a revenue stream to make the treatment more available. One group, PrEP4ALL, expressed disappointment Tuesday, saying “American taxpayers have been robbed once again.”If the verdict stands, the group said, “it will not only perpetuate harm to the American people but also threaten to set a dangerous precedent, encouraging other drug companies to privatize and profit from publicly developed technology with impunity.”",

The injury occurred in the first period as players swarmed for a loose puck and Golden Knights forward Chandler Stephenson pushed Barron, bringing his face into contact with the skate of Vegas goalie Laurent Brossoit.“I was trying to figure out if the puck went in because it was pretty close,” Barron said. “I kind of saw the skate coming. It was an unlucky play, I think. A little bit unfortunate.

We’re all so worried about the puck crossing the line, and all of the sudden we see a trail of blood all the way from the crease to the bench.”Barron, who typically centers Winnipeg’s third or fourth line, appeared in 70 games this season, with eight goals and 13 assists while averaging 13:15 of ice time.Despite all my rage, I'm still just a Bear in a cage 🐻🎶 pic.twitter.com/pwkSDPQuB8",

      "title": "Anthony Mantha’s ‘crazy tough’ season was a struggle. He got a mental coach to help. ",
      "text": "When Anthony Mantha was scratched for the first time with the Washington Capitals back in January, it was a wake-up call. It was difficult to imagine a player of Mantha’s status reaching that low: A 2013 first-round pick who was once a key part of the Detroit Red Wings’ rebuild before the Capitals traded for him two years ago to bolster their own lineup, Mantha was always among the most physically gifted players in any game he played. And he was certainly among the most handsomely paid, carrying an average salary of $5.7 million into this season.But the wake-up call from this winter lasted months. Mantha, 28, was a healthy scratch for a string of games before the all-star break, and by the time he returned to the Capitals for the second half of the season, his confidence was low. He scored just two goals in his final 28 games. He was demoted in the lineup, and his playing time dipped. He gave up a costly turnover that led to a game-winning goal by Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin in a heartbreaking loss that all but sealed Washington being eliminated from postseason contention for the first time in nine years.“It was crazy tough,” Mantha said. “Being scratched is hard. … You come back and try to get things going and get your confidence. Sometimes it’s way harder than people can imagine.”Now Mantha sits at a crossroads. He has one year remaining on his lucrative contract, and while he doesn’t know if he will be moved this offseason, he has vowed to return to Washington for training camp “with some fire just to prove to everyone that I can do the job.”As Mantha struggled through the scratches this season, he started to work with a mental coach through a company in Toronto. His confidence did return after the first several sessions. Even as he was struggling through one of the most difficult periods of his career, it allowed him to make short-term gains. “It’s making commitments, making decisions, making goals,” he said, which he hopes will lay the groundwork for the offseason and better equip him for handling the mental rigors of professional hockey next season.“Players need help with the mental part of the game. It’s hard to handle all the ups and downs,” Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said. “You have to be a mature guy to brush some of the stuff off that’s being said about you and come out and compete and get to your highest level. I think various personalities and types of players can handle that better than others. Some need help; some don’t need help.”Mantha had arrived for training camp last year facing heavy expectations and vowed to play all 82 games. His previous campaign had been marred by shoulder surgery and a lengthy rehab. Mantha started strong, posting three goals in his first five games. But as he struggled through an early-season slump, former Capitals coach Peter Laviolette tried him on different lines and on the second power-play unit, neither of which sparked his game. When he was scratched for the first time in January, Mantha said, concerns about his work ethic and not his offensive production led to the decision. By the end of the season, he continued to take responsibility for underwhelming performance and downplayed any tension with Laviolette.“I don’t think it’s anything between us. I think it’s just me, myself to blame,” said Mantha, who finished with 11 goals and 16 assists in 67 games. “Maybe my lack of skating or my lack of shooting or my decision-making. . . . It takes a toll on your confidence. And then after that, you’re just looking for your game that maybe’s not present.”He will spend the offseason trying to rediscover that game. Mantha works out with a group of NHLers over the summer, including New York Rangers star Alexis Lafrenière. He plans to spend extensive time competing in a three-on-three league. And he will continue to work with the mental coach he hired during his difficult season.“It’s not the season I wanted. I want to come back here and prove to everyone, including myself, that they came to get me for a reason,” Mantha said. “That’s exactly my mental state of mind.”",

      "title": "Right place, right time twice: How Jake Irvin wound up with the Nats ",
      "text": "Before Jake Irvin threw a pitch at Kauffman Stadium in 2014 — which was right before he was officially recruited by the University of Oklahoma, which preceded his entire life changing — a lot had to happen. The butterfly effect feels especially relevant in baseball scouting, especially when an unknown pitcher is from Bloomington, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis best known for the Mall of America, not pumping out pro athletes.Irvin needed to be in the right place at the right time. He actually needed to be in the right place at the right time twice.“It was a lot of dumb luck, to be honest with you,” said Irvin, who is slated to make his second career start when the Washington Nationals face the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on Monday night. He was a shortstop, pitching occasionally, until his junior year at Thomas Jefferson High. But one winter day in 2014, months before he attended a pro showcase at Kauffman, home of the Kansas City Royals, Irvin pitched in front of Justin Musil, who had just started a company to help players with the college recruiting process.Musil, now in scouting with the Milwaukee Brewers, would hop from indoor game to indoor game, searching for hidden gems. And Irvin, about 6-foot-5 and 180 pounds, was firmly in that category. Musil loved Irvin’s curveball, still his go-to pitch, and how much arm speed he could generate at his size. He threw in the mid to high 80s, though Musil could project a velocity jump, then another, then maybe another once Irvin’s body filled out.Nationals’ Stone Garrett, back in Arizona, remembers his big-league shotSo after seeing him pitch for Thomas Jefferson, Musil reached out to Irvin and his family. Irvin had planned to apply to college as a regular old student, not a baseball player. Most of his friends were hockey-obsessed. It snowed well into the spring in Bloomington, something prospects in Florida, Texas and Southern California never had to worry about. To Irvin, baseball was more about having fun than plotting a future. He learned his curveball grip by messing around in the backyard. He honed the pitch by throwing it from shortstop to first base during practice, a way of messing with his teammates.But now that he was pitching full time, Irvin attracted interest from a few schools at American Legion tournaments. Notre Dame, Creighton, Kansas and Kansas State were intrigued. And once he began working with Baseball Recruiting Confidential, Musil’s connections went to work.At the time, Musil was an associate scout for the Texas Rangers, who also employed a scout named Dustin Smith. Smith ran a showcase every summer at Kauffman Stadium for the Midwest’s best high school players. Musil mentioned Irvin to Smith, hoping he could get Irvin to the event. Then Irvin and his dad made the 11-hour drive from Bloomington, hoping Irvin would impress.“That was an extremely tight showcase,” Musil said. “That was not one where they are just allowing anyone. But knowing Jake and knowing how much he wanted it, just knowing how good of a dude he is, I was confident in the recommendation no matter what. We were pretty new to the scene, and reliable scouting was a big part of our reputation.”“It’s a phenomenal event to hit because, for one day, you have all the best kids in a really big region on one field,” said Pete Hughes, who was Oklahoma’s coach in 2014. “For the most part, you’re there to see a guy you’ve caught five, six, seven times already. But every once in a while, you get a guy from the Dakotas, from Minnesota, who none of the 15o scouts and coaches have heard of before.”Every once in a while, in other words, Jake Irvin comes along.Nationals’ miracle comeback is all for naught in 8-7 loss to Diamondbacks“I am waiting in the dugout, and every pitcher is throwing 94, 95, just lighting up the radar gun,” Irvin recalled. “I’m topping out at 88 at that point. I wasn’t really sure I was supposed to be there, but I knew I had to stand out somehow. So I went up there and threw a first-pitch curveball, and the guy in the box swung through it.”Up in the stands, Hughes noted Irvin’s curveball. Then he kept watching him pitch off it.“What I loved was that he had a plus-plus breaking ball he could throw for strikes,” Hughes said. “Sometimes people are funny when they have to project the velocity on a kid who’s 180 pounds of skin and bones. But it was an easy one for me, really.”Two weeks later, Irvin visited Hughes and the staff in Norman, Okla. He committed shortly thereafter. Irvin certainly didn’t need Musil and Hughes to launch his career. There could have been another scout or college coach. There could have been another showcase, maybe one closer to home. But those months set off the chain of events that made him the Nationals’ fourth-round pick in 2018.Tommy John surgery delayed his climb through Washington’s system. This year, he impressed in spring training and earned his chance when Chad Kuhl went on the injured list, logging 4⅓ solid innings last week in a 2-1 win over the Chicago Cubs at Nationals Park in his major league debut. Hughes, now the coach at Kansas State, was there with Irvin’s friends and family, completing the circle after almost nine years.He sat in a big league park and watched Irvin throw his curveball to talented hitters. And Irvin only wanted to belong.",

      "text": "Consumers are in love with cash-back offers, and now the opportunity for a higher yield on their savings.The marketing strategy is attractive: Spend and save at the same time.The latest big-name entry is Apple, which teamed up with Goldman Sachs to offer an FDIC-insured savings account with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.15 percent. Use your Apple Card, and the cash back you receive can be deposited straight into a savings account.That rate definitely beats the pitifully low national average, which is 0.24 percent APY, according to Bankrate’s April 26 weekly survey.The card is one of the better ones, with no annual, late or foreign transaction fees.“Our goal is to build tools that help users lead healthier financial lives,” Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, said in a statement.Bailey went on to say that building saving into the Apple Card will enable people to “spend, send, and save.”Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate and CreditCards.com, said that “Apple’s 4.15 percent APY isn’t at the very top of the table, but it’s close.”If you want more personal finance advice that's timeless, order your copy of Michelle Singletary's Money Milestones.The loyalty strategy is threefold, he points out: You need an Apple device to get an Apple Card, and you need an Apple Card to get an Apple savings account.“There’s definitely a stickiness to keeping more dollars and more attention focused within the Apple ecosystem,” he said. “I certainly wouldn’t want anyone to overspend just to earn cash back.”The announcement created quite a bit of buzz.Now you can ‘buy now, pay later’ with Apple WalletBut can I drop some financial wisdom on you?You never save when you spend. This is one of my go-to money mantras. It puts marketing ploys in perspective.To get cash back or the so-called “free” things you get with reward credit cards, you have to do a lot of spending. How does that create wealth?It doesn’t.It’s a clever business model disguised as good money management. The theory is if you’re going to spend anyway, why not make some money back or earn a free airline ticket?I’ve found, working with hundreds of consumers, that when we use credit — and I’m counting myself, too — we spend more than if we were limited to cash.And let me stop you before you rush to comment or send an email swearing you only buy what you absolutely need on credit and are therefore beating the system.You can believe that lie if you want, but plastic card usage — debit or credit — removes us from the pain of paying, enticing us to spend more. Even the most money-conscious consumers get caught in this credit card trap. It’s worse if you don’t pay off your charges every month. The average credit card rate is 20 percent right now.Credit card debt hit a record high. Here’s one way to pay it down.I used to be an extreme couponer until a thief stole my wallet full of coupons. That’s when I realized I was so obsessed with getting a deal that I was purchasing multiples of certain products I didn’t need, tying up cash that could be put to better use invested.There’s a lot of excitement about high-yield savings accounts. And that makes sense. People are eager to eke out every bit of earnings they can from parked savings.“Higher interest rates on deposits are one of the silver linings of the Fed’s series of rate hikes,” Rossman said, referencing the Federal Reserve’s campaign to tamp down inflation, “which have made borrowing much more expensive but deposits more attractive than they’ve been in years.”How much can you earn chasing savings rates?DepositAccounts looked at Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data to determine how banking fees and interest earnings changed between 2021 and 2022.Banks paid out $78.7 billion to U.S. deposit accounts last year, or 223 percent more than the $24.3 billion paid in 2021. Percentage-wise, that’s a big gain for all depositors. Hallelujah, and about time after such low rates on our deposits.The average interest earnings were $90.99 per deposit account in 2022, compared with $32.60 the year before.Apple thinks building credit should be a family affair. No 13-year-old needs credit.Now let’s compare that with bank fees.Banks collected $33.1 billion in fees in 2022, down from $34.0 billion the year before. The typical account was charged $39.35 in bank fees, down from $44.86 in 2021, a 12 percent decline, according to the DepositAccounts study.The average account basically broke even in the second quarter of 2022, earning an average of $10.71 that quarter in interest while paying $10.63 in fees. By the fourth quarter of 2022, the accounts earned an average of $47.16 in interest and paid $8.47 in bank fees.If you are going to park a lot of money for a long time, sure, look for a high-yield deposit account. But if money is moving in and out of your account, the amount you earn in interest isn’t going to be enormous.Take advantage of cash-back offers and high-yield accounts, but spend just as much of your time making sure you make money moves that don’t start with spending.If you have a personal finance question for Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary, please call 1-855-ASK-POST (1-855-275-7678).Recession-proof your life: The tsunami of economic news is leading consumers, investors and would-be homeowners alike to ask whether a recession is inevitable.

      "title": "Invoking the 14th Amendment to dodge the debt limit is risky, Biden aides fear",
      "text": "Senior White House officials see enormous risks in trying to resolve the debt ceiling impasse without Congress, viewing the unilateral measures floated by some academics only as emergency measures of last resort, according to three people with knowledge of internal conversations.As they have for months, Biden aides have recently been evaluating a wide range of proposals for acting on the debt limit without the consent of Congress — particularly by invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution to declare the limit unconstitutional and keep borrowing to pay bills even if the cap isn’t raised.But internally, advisers view the options as risky choices that could cause lasting economic damage, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. White House aides do not want to take the proposals completely off the table. If the federal government actually can’t borrow more, the United States could be in uncharted territory with no clear way to avoid calamity, which would make extreme measures more appealing. Administration officials are adamant that Congress must act to raise the debt limit, believing this is the only sure way to avoid financial turmoil.On Monday, the National Association of Government Employees — which represents thousands of federal workers — sued to challenge the legal basis of the debt ceiling, arguing the law gives the president the unconstitutional authority not to carry out spending laws passed by Congress. The lawsuit is seeking an injunction to prevent the suspension of federal operations due to the debt limit.“This litigation is both an effort to protect our members from illegal furloughs and to correct an unconstitutional statute that frequently creates uncertainty and anxiety for millions of Americans,” NAGE National President David J. Holway said in a statement.Mint the coin? Buy back bonds? 7 ‘gimmicks’ for dodging the debt limit.Since the debt ceiling fights that began during the Obama administration, some legal experts have argued that the White House can ignore Congress and simply declare the borrowing limit to be incompatible with the 14th Amendment, which says “the validity of the public debt, authorized by law … shall not be questioned.” Under this theory, the Treasury Department could keep borrowing money past the limit, issuing federal debt to keep government operations funded. The administration would argue that Congress had approved two irreconcilable laws — the debt ceiling, and then measures that require spending in excess of the limit.Other unilateral proposals studied internally but taken less seriously include issuing bonds that never mature and therefore technically don’t count against the borrowing limit, or minting a $1 trillion platinum coin to be deposited at the Federal Reserve.But administration officials think these kinds of moves could backfire dangerously.Any option to act without Congress would probably be subject to immediate legal challenge by Republicans as an overreach of executive authority. No matter what the merits of the debate are, Biden officials fear that investors would demand much higher interest rates to buy government debt that the courts could throw out, because prospects for repayment would be unclear. That could lead federal borrowing costs to spike, as well as drive up rates for other loans, and it could still lead to the same broader panic in financial markets that it is intended to avoid, administration officials fear.1/4“You have to worry about the interest rates, the market reaction, the effect on financial markets that rely on Treasurys. There’s no way to avoid potentially significant economic damage given the debate that would ensue,” said David Kamin, who served as deputy director of the White House National Economic Council earlier in the Biden administration.Kamin, who was involved in the administration’s internal discussions about the debt limit during a standoff in 2021, said he thinks the White House would have a strong case that the borrowing limit is unconstitutional — but the crucial factor is what investors think the courts might do.“The only option where there is clarity, and you can with confidence avoid economic damage, is Congress acting, as they have in the past,” said Kamin, who emphasized he was only representing his own views.Biden aides want to force GOP to abandon debt limit threatsWhite House skepticism of unilateral action only raises the stakes of Tuesday’s meeting between Biden and congressional leaders, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whose support will be needed to raise the limit.Administration officials have largely declined to comment on their internal assessments of unilaterally lifting the debt limit.President Biden, asked about the 14th Amendment by MSNBC on Friday, said: “I’ve not gotten there yet.”Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen on Sunday reiterated that there would be “no good options” besides Congress acting. Yellen has called for Congress to abolish the debt limit altogether, but in an interview with ABC News she sounded skeptical of the merits of invoking the 14th Amendment.Treasury Secretary Yellen says debt ceiling should be permanently abolished“There is no way to protect our financial system and our economy other than Congress doing its job and raising the debt ceiling and enabling us to pay our bills,” Yellen said. “We should not get to the point where we need to consider whether the president can go on issuing debt. This would be a constitutional crisis.”Asked again, Yellen said: “It’s Congress’s job to do this. If they fail to do it, we will have an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making, and there is no action that President Biden and the U.S. Treasury can take to prevent that catastrophe.”White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also told reporters last week, “We’re not going to entertain scenarios where Congress fully compromises the full faith and credit of the United States.”Some scholars and advocates have argued that the administration should try anyway.Bob Hockett, a Cornell University law professor specializing in finance, said he is confident that at least six Supreme Court justices — and possibly as many as nine — would side with the administration rather than invite a potentially worldwide economic shock. The court could move in under one week, he added, meaning that the uncertainty for bondholders would be short-lived.Hockett said the risks of unilateral action on the debt limit are smaller than the damage that would come from agreeing to Republicans’ proposals to dramatically cut spending.“I don’t think the Supreme Court is prepared to bring on global financial calamity by finding in favor of the congressional Republicans,” Hockett said. “I think the Supreme Court would expedite review very quickly on this, and for that reason, I don’t think we’d see terrible turmoil in the markets. I think we’d have more turmoil if we have to wait to see if McCarthy and Biden will come to an accommodation.”Laurence Tribe, the Harvard law professor and prominent constitutional scholar, wrote a New York Times op-ed on Sunday arguing for a new way of invoking the 14th Amendment to escape the debt limit impasse. Tribe said Biden should argue that Congress has no right to tell the president to ignore the spending laws it approved in the first place, ignoring one law to abide another.“I don’t doubt that the interest premium would be steep, but that’s McCarthy’s fault for trying to hold the nation hostage until we’re right at the cliff — or fall over it,” Tribe told The Washington Post in a separate interview.Peter R. Orszag, who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama and is now chief executive of financial advisory at Lazard, also acknowledged potentially significant “economic and financial” harms from invoking the 14th Amendment but said administration officials should be exploring all contingency plans.Orszag emphasized the administration should not agree to only lift the debt limit temporarily until next year, as a bill the House passed would do, because that could set the stage for an election-year showdown with House Republicans emboldened to extract concessions.“Anyone saying, ‘Let’s jump to this’ — that’s premature,” Orszag said. “But in the world of hypotheticals — which I understand Secretary Yellen, for good reason, does not want to get into — where there is no option without massive negative consequences, the question is which is the least bad.”This comic illustrates the debt ceilingThere may be other potential downsides. Tobin Marcus, a former Biden policy adviser now at Evercore ISI, an investment advisory firm, pointed out that regardless of the debt ceiling debate, the White House will still need to reach an agreement with Congress to fund the government. The federal government will shut down Oct. 1 without a bipartisan agreement on spending, and there are no widely discussed options for doing that unilaterally.“Not only are there unanswerable questions about legality and market reaction, but unilateral action on the debt ceiling will make a bipartisan spending deal this fall even harder,” Marcus said. “They may decide at the very last minute that unilateral action is the least bad solution, but it’s certainly not an ideal solution.”The latest: Today, President Biden will meet with congressional leaders in an urgent bid to avoid a government default. White House officials see enormous risks in trying to resolve the debt ceiling impasse without Congress.Understanding the debt ceiling fight: Biden and the House Republican leadership are on a collision course over the national debt limit. Here’s when the debt ceiling battle could end.What is at stake? If the debt limit is breached, Biden warned that it could send the U.S. economy into a free fall. The debt ceiling breach could wipe out 8 million jobs, a recent White House analysis found. Amid consumer anxiety over the uncertainty, financial experts warn against making fear-based decisions.",

      "title": "Analysis | How Imran Khan’s Fight for Power Fuels Pakistan Crisis",
      "text": "Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was ousted by a no-confidence vote in 2022, is making a major push to return to power. He wants the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to call early elections, which Khan thinks he would win comfortably. The former international cricket star has already won several by-elections, led big protest rallies and even escaped an alleged assassination attempt. Khan has also locked horns with the country’s powerful army, which has ruled the country for about half of its 75-year existence, fueling an escalating legal battle. 1. What does Imran Khan want?The 70-year-old ex-premier has demanded the 13-party coalition government that replaced him set a date for early elections, which aren’t due until October. In by-elections late last year, Khan won six out of seven seats that he personally contested, demonstrating his continued popular appeal. He continues to stage rallies to press for early polls. An opinion poll published in March found his approval rating had climbed dramatically while that of the government sank, dragged down by months of soaring inflation and economic turmoil. 2. What are the obstacles?He’s facing multiple court cases, including one for allegedly hiding assets, that could result in him being sentenced to prison or disqualified from holding public office, if convicted. Paramilitary troops arrested him on May 9 on the orders of the anti-corruption bureau, though it was unclear how long he’d be held. There’s also a history of political violence. During a rally last year, Khan was shot in the leg. He has repeatedly blamed his successor and a senior general for the attack. Both Sharif and the military condemned the shooting. In a rare statement directed at Khan in May, the military asked for the allegations to be addressed in court. 3. Why was Khan ousted? During his turbulent 3 1/2 years in office, Khan demonstrated an approach to governing that critics characterized as haphazard and inconsistent. Facing a balance-of-payments crisis, he delayed seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. He finally did so in 2019, only to see the program suspended in 2020 because of the pandemic. The plan was revived in 2021 — after another stall — after Khan agreed to tougher conditions, including raising oil prices and electricity tariffs. But a few months later, Khan cut domestic fuel costs and power rates to soothe public anger over rising living costs, again putting the IMF program in jeopardy. The Sharif administration has been struggling to restart the $6.5 billion bailout, without which it risks a default this year.  4. What does Khan say?He has accused Sharif and other politicians of conspiring with the former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa to topple his government because — he says — he had been increasingly critical of the US while seeking better relations with Russia and China. Initially he also accused the US of orchestrating his ouster, but he has softened his tone on the campaign trail, saying he seeks good relations with Washington. Khan provided no proof for his earlier claim, which was denied by the US, the Sharif government and Pakistan’s military. However, his conspiracy theory has gone down well with his supporters. Emboldened by strong support in opinion polls, Khan has shown no signs of backing down in his call for an early general election and is seeking support from the Supreme Court to hold early elections in two provinces for a start.5. Why is the military’s position important?Pakistan’s military has outsized power in a country conceived as a democracy. There have been three successful military coups. When Khan became prime minister, it was only the second time since the creation of Pakistan in 1947 that one civilian administration had transferred power to another. Even when elected governments are in power, the military has played a forceful role in foreign and security policies. That’s especially true of its spy wing, the Inter-Service Intelligence, or ISI, which oversees internal security. The armed forces have entrenched positions in the economy through land ownership and shareholdings in large corporations.6. Did the military support Khan?Khan has said his relations with the military for his first three years in power were “excellent,” and that he and Bajwa were on the “same page” on all issues — an arrangement critics referred to as a hybrid regime. In behind-the-scenes maneuvers, the armed forces helped him survive several moves by opponents to remove him from power, according to interviews Khan gave after his ouster. (The military has denied helping him.) His government extended Bajwa’s term as army chief for another three years in 2019. However, relations soured in October 2021 when former General Faiz Hameed, the ex-chief of the military’s spy agency and a Khan favorite, was moved to a less significant post. The military announced his replacement, Lieutenant General Nadeem Ahmad Anjum, three weeks before the government did, sparking reports of a rift between Khan and Bajwa. When a new challenge to Khan’s leadership arose last year, the military apparently didn’t back him, opposition parties and analysts say.7. What’s at stake?Sharif has rejected early election calls by saying he wants to see through the IMF program and the government term. But he’s lost popular support as voters blame his coalition for the economy’s dire straits. Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded the country’s rating deep into junk, citing the impact of last year’s floods, which caused more than $30 billion in damage to the economy. Pakistan took the crown for Asia’s fastest inflation from Sri Lanka in April, and the rupee is one of the worst performing currencies globally as of May, declining 20% to the dollar, and making imported goods more expensive. Continued political turmoil makes solving such problems more difficult.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "LONDON — The festivities for the coronation of King Charles III were a star-studded affair. Dignitaries flew in from around the world to witness the pageantry and regalia. The military hosted an air show. Celebrities performed at a special concert.But for first lady Jill Biden, in attendance over the weekend to represent the United States, the coronation was also an occasion to drink tea and eat finger sandwiches on the street — as well as visit a familiar studio for some cardio.Biden and Akshata Murty, wife of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, attended a 9:30 a.m. SoulCycle class in London’s posh Notting Hill neighborhood the morning after the coronation.A company spokesperson confirmed via email that the two women secured spots in Sunday’s class “on a walk-in basis.” (News of their attendance was first reported by People.)After the one-hour “SoulSurvivor” session — taught by instructor Abbey Ashley — Biden and Murty met up again at No. 10 Downing Street for a “special Coronation lunch” in honor of “community heroes, Ukrainian families and youth groups.”The lunch, served on long picnic tables outside the prime minister’s residence, consisted of food sourced from throughout the United Kingdom, including beef from Gloucestershire in southwestern England and ice cream from Wales, Downing Street said.British media outlets, alert for moments of cross-Atlantic humor, seized on Biden’s seeming confusion as she picked up a finger sandwich. “Jill Biden looks baffled by a cheese and pickle sandwich at lunch with Rishi Sunak,” read the Express.The Downing Street meal was one of over 50,000 events organized across the United Kingdom on Sunday as part of an initiative known as the Big Lunch, designed to bring “neighbours and communities together to share friendship, food and fun.”Biden attended with her granddaughter Finnegan. In a tweet, the first lady thanked Sunak and his wife “for welcoming me to your Coronation Big Lunch as we mark this special moment in history.”Sunday’s Big Lunch capped off a busy few days for the first lady.On Friday, she and Murty met with participants in a veterans charity boxing event called the Fighting Chance.And accompanied by her granddaughter and Jane Hartley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, Biden and Murty visited the Charles Dickens Primary School in South London, greeting staffers and students. The children wore paper crowns.“Have fun tomorrow, I’ll be thinking about all of you,” Biden told them, according to Reuters.Biden also visited the U.S. Embassy in London, meeting staff members and taking part in a “moment of silence to remember fallen Foreign Service Officers” in honor of Foreign Service Day, the embassy said in a tweet.Friday evening was capped by a reception for coronation guests from overseas, hosted by the royal family at Buckingham Palace.

Her granddaughter wore a yellow dress with a cape by the fashion label Markarian, the outlet reported.Later in the weekend, the first lady and her granddaughter “toasted the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla” alongside Hartley and her husband, the ambassador tweeted.Yesterday evening we toasted the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla, and celebrated the eternal bond between our two countries with our guest of honor @FLOTUS Dr. Jill Biden. #Coronation pic.twitter.com/RSqVvRjv9kIn an interview with the Associated Press after the coronation, Biden said it was “just amazing to see” the “pageantry of the ceremony.”“You can’t imagine that moment where you actually see the crown being placed on the head of the king and then on the head [of] the queen,” she told the AP. “As I sat there, I felt this sense of decorum and civility that binds together people of all nations.”",

But it signaled this week it might suspend its aggressive hikes contingent on the state of the economy.Still, a pause doesn’t mean the cost of credit will come down.“Even if the Fed is done hiking rates, which is still a matter of some debate, Fed officials are talking as if they could keep rates elevated into next year and perhaps even beyond,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate.com and CreditCards.com. “In other words, we’re not expecting much relief anytime soon for things like credit card rates.”Think of the 10 Fed rate increases over the last 14 months like that nasty-tasting medicine your mom forced you to take as a kid.

      "title": "Here’s what’s in the House GOP bill to raise debt limit, cut spending",
      "text": "President Biden on Tuesday plans to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other congressional leaders to discuss the debt ceiling, embarking on new, high-stakes talks with as few as three weeks remaining before the U.S. government could default.The discussions come weeks after the House defied Biden and approved a GOP-backed bill that would raise the debt ceiling into next year, slash federal spending by billions of dollars and unwind some of the president’s priorities, including his program to cancel college student debt.The Treasury Department last week warned that the government could breach the debt ceiling — the limit on how much the U.S. can borrow to pay its bills — as early as June 1. That could cause the government to default, unleashing economic havoc that could plunge the country into another recession.Even though Republicans say they do not wish to default, the party only has hardened in its resolve to exploit the key fiscal deadline for political leverage. Democrats, meanwhile, vehemently opposed the House GOP legislation, arguing it could inflict considerable harm on American families’ finances.The president has maintained that Republicans should increase the debt limit without conditions, saying that a miscalculation that triggers a default could push the economy into a recession. And he has pointed out that Democrats repeatedly aided Republicans in raising the borrowing cap, even when the party opposed policies enacted under President Donald Trump.Here’s what the GOP bill would do:At the center of the fight is the debt ceiling, the legal limit on how much the United States can borrow to pay its bills.The United States hit its current limit — set at $31 trillion — in January, prompting the Treasury Department to start making special maneuvers to continue paying federal bills and stave off a fiscal calamity. But the Biden administration may run out of options as soon as early June.House Republicans would raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion, or suspend it until March 31, 2024, whichever occurs first. That would prevent a default, but it would also tee up a return to the same battle in just over a year — right before the next presidential election. Behind the scenes, GOP leaders have touted that time frame as a selling point with their members, because it may give them another opportunity to make more demands of the White House.The GOP proposal would slash the federal budget back to levels adopted in the 2022 fiscal year, then cap federal agencies’ future budget growth at 1 percent for the next decade. In total, the spending reductions could achieve more than $3 trillion in savings over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which scored a version of the legislation this week.The cuts probably would target federal health care, science, education, climate, energy, labor and research programs, while leaving untouched the Pentagon and services for veterans. But the bill does not specify the exact agencies or programs on the chopping block, leaving the task to lawmakers on congressional appropriations committees who craft spending bills that keep the government running and stave off a shutdown.Highlighting the harm of such cuts earlier this year, Biden administration officials predicted more flight delays, slower Social Security checks, reduced college aid for needy students and significant reductions in the number of people served by affordable housing programs, according to letters they sent to Congress earlier this year.The missives, which analyzed an earlier version of the GOP plan, said cuts back to 2022 levels would also hamstring government agencies that respond to extreme weather, eliminate 170,000 slots in a key federal preschool program, and impact the IRS and its ability to provide timely refunds.Millions of low-income Americans who receive food stamps and health insurance from the federal government would have to work longer hours in exchange for benefits under the new GOP bill.First, the bill targets the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It would subject adults without children to new work requirements until they reach age 56, replacing current law, which only imposes those rules until age 49.The GOP bill would also make it harder for states to spare certain families on SNAP from federal work requirements — a flexibility some states have used to help lower-income people during times of high unemployment.With Medicaid, meanwhile, Republicans proposed a rule requiring the low-income recipients of federal health insurance to satisfy certain income or work thresholds. That includes, for example, participating in 80 hours per month in employment or community service — otherwise states could remove these enrollees from the safety-net program. The rules would cover beneficiaries from age 19 until age 56, with some exceptions, such as for those who are pregnant or caring for young children.In late tweaks to the bill meant to satisfy far-right conservatives, GOP leaders agreed to speed up implementation of their new work requirements, which would take effect starting in the 2024 fiscal year. With SNAP, they also included new language that says the “purpose” of the program is to “assist low-income adults in obtaining employment.”The work requirements may save the government money, but they threaten to come at the cost of millions of families’ financial well-being, according to some outside estimates. Analyzing the GOP proposal, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities predicted that 10 million people in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage are at a “significant risk” of losing benefits if the bill became law.The GOP plan officially aims to block Biden’s forthcoming program to cancel thousands of dollars in college debt, a program long sought by cash-strapped students that the Supreme Court is also examining.Biden announced in August his plan to wipe out $10,000 in debt for Americans who earn less than $125,000 annually, and $20,000 for lower-income borrowers. Republicans quickly blasted the financial relief as unfair, claiming that it is wrong to use taxpayer dollars — paid, in part, by those who did not attend college — to ease the debts of Americans who did.With it, Republicans also included a provision that would block one of Biden’s programs meant to lower student’s monthly loan bills. That initiative essentially shielded more of Americans’ income from calculations on what they owe under a repayment program known as IDR, which applies to federal loans.The GOP bill targets at least some of the $80 billion set aside to improve the Internal Revenue Service and help the government pursue unpaid taxes.Democrats originally approved the money last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a centerpiece of Biden’s economic agenda that aimed to lower health-care costs and boost clean energy. They saw it as a critical way to ease a backlog at the tax agency while empowering it to investigate wealthy Americans and corporations that fail to pay what they owe — a disparity known as the “tax gap” that may cost the government $1 trillion annually.But House Republicans have charged that the influx in funding would empower the IRS to hire thousands of new agents to audit innocent Americans. Earlier this year, they voted to undo the budget boost, though the legislation has no chance of passage in the Senate.In its own analysis, the CBO found that the new IRS spending would have a significant return on investment, helping to reduce the deficit by $120 billion over the next decade. As a result, the GOP repeal would wipe out those savings before Washington can take advantage of them, essentially adding to the deficit in the process.Republicans have made no secret about their opposition to the Inflation Reduction Act’s investments to fight climate change.The GOP debt ceiling legislation would repeal broad swaths of the tax policies meant to cut greenhouse gas emissions and incentivize the deployment of green energy. That includes a partial end to tax credits for electric vehicles: It would ax the $4,000 credits for used vehicles and phase out some of the $7,500 credits for new EVs.But Republicans ultimately dialed back some of their original plans, under pressure from moderate lawmakers — particularly those in Midwestern states — who balked at unwinding tax credits meant to boost ethanol and solar energy. GOP leaders updated their bill in the hours before debate to allow some of those investments to continue.The GOP bill would claw back unspent money authorized in previous coronavirus aid packages. In prior appearances on Capitol Hill, federal officials have estimated that amount is probably less than $100 billion.GOP leaders also included a slew of additional policies, such as the adoption of what is called the Reins Act, which would grant Congress major new authority to review and overturn health, labor and other rules issued by federal agencies. And they tacked on permitting legislation that could ease the way for more oil and gas drilling.Maxine Joselow and Rachel Roubein contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Analysis | In hiring a general manager, the Wizards should think smaller",
      "text": "Several Monumental Sports & Entertainment employees cited a common feeling circulating through team headquarters this past week after CEO Ted Leonsis fired Tommy Sheppard as president and general manager of the Washington Wizards.It goes something like this: This time, it can’t take three months.Leonsis launched a hunt for a general manager for the second time in four years Wednesday, and there is at least one major difference between now and 2019. In the sequel, Leonsis did not name an interim general manager, as he did with Sheppard back then. While work at the Wizards’ offices continues, the question of “So whom exactly do you report to now?” was met this past week with a whole lot of “I’m not sure.”With the draft lottery set for May 16 and the draft itself arriving a little more than a month later, Leonsis must be feeling some sense of urgency. That’s change enough from four years ago, when he took the time to speak with 78 advisers before finally promoting Sheppard in July from interim to full-time general manager.Wizards fire president and general manager Tommy SheppardThat’s a start as far as mind-set changes go. But Leonsis could take it a step further and not just revamp his front office but set a new tone for how the Wizards think about themselves.Sheppard is gone, meaning the last remnants of the Ernie Grunfeld era are out after two decades. Should Leonsis want to grab hold of this golden opportunity for a fresh start, he could look around the NBA for recent success stories — Milwaukee, Memphis, Sacramento — and realize it might be time for the Wizards to downsize.Or at least to start thinking smaller.Masai Ujiri, vice chairman and president of the Toronto Raptors, and Bob Myers, president of basketball operations and general manager of the Golden State Warriors, are big names floating around as potential candidates for the Wizards. Hiring either would be a big-market move — both have the sparkling résumé, street cred and know-how to attract big-name talent. Both would come with a price tag appropriate for best-in-class executives. And both, given their success in the NBA, presumably would come in wanting the type of control Leonsis has been reluctant to hand over.Case in point: Leonsis has already put up guardrails in backing Coach Wes Unseld Jr., who will return for a third season.But instead of daydreaming about Ujiri and Myers, why not think like a midmarket team? Go after a basketball mind who will focus on getting the on-court product up and running first. Recruit an under-the-radar, fresh talent evaluator who has succeeded in moderate markets; that’s where the Wizards exist. The D.C. metro area, despite having all the perks of a big city, isn’t Miami or Los Angeles. Goodness knows the taxes aren’t as friendly as they are in Texas and Florida, and it doesn’t attract free agents as a typical big-market organization does.No problem. Neither did Milwaukee, once upon a time. That’s a strong argument for ticket-buyers. Wizards fans might not need a big name on the court, but they do love young, exciting talent willing to embrace the city. Think of how folks latched on to Jordan Goodwin this season. This is the city of the Goodman and Kenner leagues. The people just like good basketball.Leonsis going a little — just a little — smaller feels like the best way to bring it to them.Here are four names to consider, all of whom have been mentioned as potential candidates in recent days by rival front-office executives and people within the Wizards organization:The New Orleans Pelicans’ general manager honed his craft working under Nets GM Sean Marks, first in San Antonio and then in Brooklyn, where he was named assistant general manager in 2016 before the Pelicans hired him  in 2019. His name has come up frequently since Sheppard’s exit, and he earned special praise for landing Trey Murphy III in a draft-day trade. Murphy, 22, has evolved into one of the Pelicans’ rising stars: He averaged 14.5 points on 48.4 percent shooting from the field and 40.6 percent from beyond the arc in his second NBA season.The New York Knicks’ GM has quite the résumé: He worked in the Detroit Pistons’ front office under Joe Dumars during their run as a title contender in the early 2000s, a stretch that included a championship in 2004. Perry also drafted Kevin Durant with the No. 2 pick in his time with the Seattle SuperSonics. Other draft highlights include selecting Victor Oladipo and Aaron Gordon in Orlando before he moved to New York in 2020.Kawhi Leonard’s knee sprain sends Clippers back to square one. Again.If you’re looking for the right combination of under the radar and highly talented, picking from the league’s ranks of assistant general managers isn’t a bad idea. Newton, who holds that title in Milwaukee, is a highly regarded talent evaluator who was with the Wizards from 2003 to 2013, mostly working as vice president of player personnel. As GM in Minnesota from 2013 to 2016, he traded Kevin Love to Cleveland in a deal that brought in 2014 No. 1 pick Andrew Wiggins; he also drafted Karl-Anthony Towns and Zach Lavine.If Ujiri and Myers cost too much for Leonsis, the same could be said of Connelly. He isn’t making as much as Ujiri, but the Timberwolves’ head honcho is somewhere in the $8 million range (and reportedly has ownership equity as a sweetener). But some in Minnesota might take a pay cut to get away from Rudy Gobert. If Connelly does, well, Leonsis has forked over that kind of cash before — former coach Scott Brooks made $7 million per year back when he was part of the plan to lure Durant to Washington.Connelly’s name must be on the list of candidates because he has the most buzz of any candidate and because it just makes sense. If you’re asking which newly hired GM would be okay walking into an organization with a coach preselected for him, the answer might be Connelly, who has been close buddies with Unseld for about two decades.Connelly is a Baltimore native who began his career in the Wizards’ video room in the late 1990s before building the Denver Nuggets, with whom Unseld was an assistant before joining the Wizards, into a powerhouse. The biggest argument against Connelly, aside from his paycheck, is that he’s coming off a year in which he orchestrated the ill-fated trade to bring in Gobert from the Utah Jazz. At least the Timberwolves made the playoffs.",

      "text": "Reader: I am part of a two-person office in a medium-sized nonprofit organization. My senior co-worker, “Richie,” is the executive director, and I am in an administrative position overseeing a gaggle of interns and freelancers.Richie is an impossible mess. Disorganized, distracted and woefully incompetent. He is an “unfiltered thought” person; if he thinks it, he blurts it out. Since the pandemic we both work from home and see each other maybe once a month, which is perfect for me. I live in the city, he lives in a suburb. Part of his daily routine is to call me from his car to “check in” during work hours while he’s on his way to the store, or late in the afternoon when he’s picking up his kids. We get no work done when he calls from the car, especially when he’s road-raging at random people. In the middle of a work conversation, he will suddenly yell expletives at another car or randomly say things like, “Where does this [person] think she’s going?”This is particularly upsetting to me as I lost a close family member in a car accident when the other driver had been texting. All my friends know, and Richie does too, that I hate talking on the phone to someone who’s driving for fear of hearing them get into an accident. When I previously mentioned my experience to Richie, he assured me he was a great driver and I needed to “toughen up.”How do I get Richie to respect my fears and stop the rude, unproductive, emotionally disturbing work calls from the car?Karla: While I’m an established fan of workplace flexibility, one of the acknowledged downsides of remote work is the blurring of boundaries between work and personal space. Not only is it detrimental to our mental health when it’s our own boundaries being erased, it’s disrespectful when we let our work encroach on others’ personal space. (To the entrepreneur conducting a speakerphone conference call at Panera: Yes, this means you.) And in the case of your colleague’s expletive-laced Mario Kart meetings, as you note, it’s downright dangerous.Given Richie’s lack of concern for other people on the road — including, apparently, his own children — appealing to his sense of empathy for your trauma is unlikely to persuade him to change his ways. And unlike your organization’s board of directors, you probably lack the authority to demand the respect of his undivided attention during these work discussions. Your remaining option is to not be on the other end of the phone.Her father was killed by a distracted driver. She found his bucket list and spent six years completing it.Bear in mind, I don’t know how much influence Richie has over your employment status and how sensitive he is to perceived insubordination. So please review all the following suggestions, presented from least to most diplomatic, before you choose whichever seems least likely to get you fired.Of course, Richie, being an impulsive type, may continue calling you whenever an idea strikes, to offload his unfiltered insights onto you for safekeeping. In that case, your goal is to get off the phone as quickly as possible while still being responsive. “What’s on your mind? Right, got it. I’ll write that down and we can discuss it in more detail later. Thanks, drive safe!” Boop.",

      "title": "The Cubs bet on veterans needing a jolt. They bet on the Cubs, too.",
      "text": "When Trey Mancini was looking for a new team this offseason, the first-time free agent was not exactly hunting from a position of maximum leverage. He slumped after being traded to the Houston Astros — one of those brutal, relentless slumps that transforms even infield hits into godsends. So the 31-year-old needed a fresh start. And something about the Chicago Cubs — something he couldn’t put into words — made him think Wrigley Field was the place to find it.“Well, along with that, they were the most interested team — I’m not going to lie,” he said. “There wasn’t a lot else going on.”Mancini wasn’t the only veteran needing a reboot who found his way to Chicago. Fallen 2019 MVP Cody Bellinger figured he would give the Cubs a try. San Diego castoff Eric Hosmer landed there, too. Catcher Tucker Barnhart, a coveted presence behind the plate, signed up to share time with Yan Gomes.The Cubs also made splashier offseason signings to bolster their core of Ian Happ, Patrick Wisdom and Nico Hoerner. They gave Dansby Swanson $177 million over seven years. They added Jameson Taillon to a rotation that relies heavily on veterans Marcus Stroman and Drew Smyly, who have found better versions of themselves on the North Side.But as they tried to reemerge as contenders, to finally move forward from that long-gone 2016 World Series core, the Cubs seemed particularly willing to take chances on players who had not been their best selves in recent years. Those players, perhaps out of necessity, seemed particularly willing to take a chance on them.“I think the Cubs have gotten a really high reputation for the infrastructure of their front office, the data, technology. Plus [Manager David] Ross and the coaching staff, they know this is a place they’re going to be comfortable,” Smyly said. “They know they’re going to get the best information to revive their career or put themselves in the best position to succeed. I know that’s how I felt when I came here, that it was easy to start progressing instead of plateauing.”Bryce Harper is back. Will the hard-charging Phillies return, too?So far, the Cubs seem to be progressing, too. They are seventh in the majors in OPS and fourth in ERA. At 17-17 and in third place, they are 2½ games behind the plummeting Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Central, looking more well rounded than the Milwaukee Brewers and distancing themselves from the free-falling St. Louis Cardinals. Despite notching just three wins in their past 10 games, they look more immune to chaos than younger contenders — the product, Barnhart and others said, of having so many players and coaches in the organization who have been through those struggles before.“The ups and the downs you feel during the season, when you have a coaching staff that has been there and experienced those ups and downs, it provides a safe space, in a way, to let yourself go through those,” Barnhart said. “You don’t feel like you have to panic when they do happen — because they are going to happen, obviously.”Comfort, veterans said, is the thing the Cubs offer in larger doses than most.Smyly signed with the Cubs ahead of the 2018 season, which he missed while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery. He pitched for four teams from 2019 to 2021, finishing 2021 with a 4.48 ERA and a World Series title with the Atlanta Braves. He signed again with the Cubs before the 2022 season, then made at least 20 starts with an ERA under 3.50 for the first time since 2014. This year, he is pitching to a 3.05 ERA and nearly had a perfect game last month before a freak run-in with Gomes ended that bid in memorably brutal fashion in the eighth inning.THIS is how Drew Smyly's perfect game bid ends??? pic.twitter.com/AHaiPZ0pA7“This offseason, I didn’t want to sign anywhere else,” said Smyly, whose teammates now wear T-shirts commemorating the history-changing collision. “I was just having so much fun.”Mancini hasn’t exactly exploded in Chicago, but he is hitting .264 with three homers — better, at least, than late last year. Hosmer has struggled, so much so that when the Cubs called up prospect Matt Mervis last week, fans wondered whether the first baseman and long-heralded clubhouse presence might be the one to go. Hosmer is still on the roster — he was the designated hitter in Sunday’s 5-4, 14-inning loss to Miami as Mervis handled first base — despite hitting below his career averages and struggling to elevate the ball.But Bellinger seems to have rediscovered the flow he lost in Los Angeles. He is hitting .300 with seven homers and a .935 OPS, best among Cubs regulars.“I think the fun part is you don’t have to treat veteran players any different than a first-year minor league player. You can look at the relationship with the player as a partnership,” General Manager Carter Hawkins said. “Everybody ultimately owns their own career. I think about me — what would I want to be my best self professionally or personally? All the information that would help make good decisions and someone to guide us along the way.”The process is not infallible. Jason Heyward seemed forever removed from his best days as he hit .211 with a .606 OPS for the Cubs in 2021 and 2022. This year, he has rejuvenated his career with the Dodgers. And Hosmer has yet to show signs of recovery, but the Cubs did not build this roster counting on those veterans to reemerge as superstars.“I think from a front-office perspective we’re probably looking more at the 50th-percentile outcome as you’re trying to make overall decisions,” Hawkins said. “But from a development or optimization standpoint, you’re trying to shoot for that 99th-percentile outcome. That’s what we’re pushing for.”Bellinger seems to be playing near the best-case scenario. Wisdom and Happ are maintaining an OPS right around .900. About to turn 26, 2018 first-round pick Hoerner has emerged as the kind of high-average, elite-defense guy the Cubs thought they were getting. And while there were some questions whether they bet too high on Swanson after his career year with the Braves in 2022, he is playing to a higher average and a comparable OPS, if not the same 25-homer pace.“The end goal is always the same for every team: to try to get the best out of the player and be the most prepared. I just think here, for me, it’s in your face. The game plan is sitting on my chair when I get here,” Barnhart said. “… The best way I can put it is that I’ve never felt more prepared than I do here.”The Cubs, too, seem more prepared for a contending year than they have at any point since they won the NL Central in the shortened 2020 season, if not before. The rest of the division seems to be fading already, but it’s still early.“We have more veteran leadership, a little more optimism and talent, and it shows on a day-to-day basis that we have a really good mix,” said Smyly, who has pitched in two World Series. “Last year, I don’t think the Cubs were there yet — ready to win. This year, it’s much more … it’s here. You can feel it.”",

      "title": "Washington and Wall Street brace for White House debt ceiling talks",
      "text": "Exiting the White House in February, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy sounded a hopeful note, describing his roughly hour-long conversation with President Biden as a “good first meeting” on fiscal issues.Ninety-seven days later, the two men are finally set to sit down again Tuesday under starkly different terms — as an intensifying political standoff threatens the nation with the once-unthinkable prospect of default.As few as three weeks remain before the United States could breach the debt ceiling — the legal maximum it can borrow to pay its bills — touching off a calamity that could hurtle the economy into a crippling recession. On Capitol Hill, Republicans in recent days have hardened in their refusal to act unless the president first agrees to spending cuts, defying Biden, who has accused GOP lawmakers of holding the nation’s credit hostage.The long-simmering stalemate took on new urgency last week, after the Treasury Department warned that the government might be unable to cover its financial obligations as soon as June 1. The ominous update spooked lawmakers and prompted Biden to invite McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his congressional counterparts — Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) — to a meeting at the White House.1/4This time, the conversation carries even greater stakes: A failure to show some progress toward a debt ceiling deal could rattle the stock market at a moment when investors already are skittish — and debt-ratings agencies have warned they could downgrade U.S. credit in the face of persistent dysfunction.“I think the markets are going to get jittery relatively quickly” if a resolution seems out of reach, predicted Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a top lawmaker on the chamber’s appropriations panel. “I hope the president will say, ‘Take your finger off the detonator.’”Top Biden administration officials have signaled in advance that the president plans to tell Republicans that he is willing to discuss spending cuts — just not as part of the debt ceiling debate. Instead, Biden hopes to shift the conversation toward the fall, when Congress typically must act to fund federal agencies before Oct. 1, preventing a government shutdown.“If you buy a car, you are expected to pay the monthly payments. If you buy a home, you are expected to pay the mortgage every month. That is the expectation,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing with reporters Monday, stressing that the debt ceiling reflects money that both parties have already spent. “So we’re telling them or saying to them, do your job, pay for something that you’ve already spent on. That’s it.”But Republican leaders have only grown more resolute in their campaign to wield the debt ceiling as political leverage. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.), a top member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, stressed that there is no GOP support for a “clean debt ceiling,” as he championed a bill adopted by the chamber last month that couples a short-term increase in borrowing authority with spending cuts and other priorities.With the clock ticking, Roy said Republicans are not inclined to accept a short-term extension, either, unless the White House agrees to some concessions.“There’s going to be some cost to that,” he said.With debt bill adopted, far-right House Republicans ready for fiscal warIn the meantime, Washington remains rife with uncertainty, since the exact day that the United States could breach the debt ceiling isn’t entirely clear. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned Congress last week that the deadline could come “potentially as early as June 1,” though she and others — in government and the private sector — have acknowledged that the exact date hinges on federal tax receipts that so far have proved to be lower than expected.“The Treasury Department is understandably in a position that even if the risk is small … they are going to flag a small risk,” said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, predicting that the government’s warning would “accelerate conversations” on Capitol Hill.Under President Donald Trump, Republicans repeatedly acted to avert a default without making any demands to reduce borrowing, even as Trump enacted a tax overhaul in 2017 that added to the federal debt. Since Biden has taken office, though, Republicans have seized on the so-called “x-date” to advance their agenda — drawing the ire of Democrats, who see the strategy as risky and hypocritical.Last month, House Republicans put their latest gambit into motion: The chamber adopted a bill that would increase the debt ceiling into next year while cutting federal spending by more than $3.5 trillion over the coming decade. The bill also would repeal some of Biden’s top priorities, including his plan to cancel some of students’ debts, and would impose new work requirements on Americans who receive Medicaid and food stamps.McCarthy described the measure as an attempt to force Democrats to the “negotiating table.” But the president threatened to veto the bill, dubbed the Limit, Save, Grow Act, while Schumer proclaimed that his chamber would not consider it. Democratic leaders instead called for an increase in the debt ceiling without conditions, which Republicans universally have rejected.The myriad disagreements loom large over the Tuesday meeting, as Biden and his invited quartet of congressional leaders race to pull back the country from the fiscal brink. The president and House speaker come to the new talks as fierce political foes, lacking any sort of relationship that might help them strike a deal under a tight time frame. Adding to the challenge, lawmakers are expected to be in session only sparingly this month, meaning their leaders have only a small window to resolve a crisis that may be weeks away.What's in the House-passed debt ceiling bill“You have a very short fuse to find a way forward here,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a co-chair of the moderate, bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, adding that Congress and the White House “need to show progress and strong signals we’re willing to work together.”A government default could unleash economic havoc, potentially disrupting Social Security and other federal services, casting millions of Americans out of their jobs, sending shock waves through the global financial system and tipping the United States into the worst downturn since the pandemic began. Even the mere prospect of a default has already troubled Wall Street, upending bond markets and prompting a credit-ratings agency — Scope Ratings, a major firm in Europe — to signal Friday that it could downgrade the United States if it fails to avert a default. It was the second such threat over the past month.Fiscal crisis nears as McCarthy takes debt ceiling plan to Wall Street“It just depends a lot on what happens in Congress,” said Michael Pugliese, a director and senior economist with Wells Fargo’s Corporate and Investment Bank. “If there’s progress toward a resolution, whatever that resolution looks like … then I think more turbulence can be avoided.”On Capitol Hill, Republicans in recent days still have encouraged their leaders to stand their ground over the debt ceiling.“I get it, the guys who day trade may get a little skittish, but we have got to make the hard decisions that drive us toward fiscal responsibility,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), chairman of the Republican Main Street Caucus, calling on Biden to engage in a “real negotiation.”“We cannot avoid a crisis without a deal, and we cannot cut a deal without a partner,” he said.Many Republicans signaled ahead of the meeting that they are unwilling to decouple the debt ceiling from the fight over spending cuts, as Biden prefers. Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), a moderate who serves on key appropriations panels, said such a move only amounts to “buying time for more bad policies,” adding: “We’re taking back the purse strings.”In the face of staunch resistance, some Democrats have tried to devise their own solutions. In the House, party lawmakers took the first procedural step last week toward forcing a vote on a bill that would raise the debt ceiling without immediate spending cuts. But the effort, announced by Jeffries, still faces tall odds because it requires a handful of Republicans to lend their support.Still another proposal — put forward by the roughly 60 centrist Democrats and Republicans in the Problem Solvers Caucus — would increase the debt ceiling until the end of the year to allow the budget and appropriations process to play out. Gottheimer said lawmakers are at work turning that blueprint into legislation, which would create a special commission to study and recommend long-term spending cuts. It could then be grafted on top of the bill that House Democratic leaders are trying to force onto the chamber floor, the congressman said.Schumer also positioned the Senate last month to act on what could be a two-year increase in the debt ceiling. But his efforts similarly hinge on Republican defections, since Democrats need at least nine GOP votes to overcome any filibuster. That prospect seemed unlikely, after 43 Republicans led by Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) signaled on Saturday that they would not support debt ceiling legislation unless it included “substantive spending and budget reforms.”McConnell, meanwhile, publicly has signaled that he is unwilling to intervene, disappointing Democrats who had hoped he might be able to broker a deal with Biden. At a news conference last week, McConnell repeated his belief that Biden and McCarthy “need to reach an agreement to get us past this impasse,” adding: “There is no solution in the Senate.”White House officials and top congressional Democrats have exhibited little interest in a short-term extension that might offer lawmakers more time to craft a deal. Jeffries, speaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said lawmakers should not “kick the can down the road” and expressed hope that the meeting at the White House on Tuesday might help them devise “a way forward to do what is necessary.”As the fears of a federal default have grown, some White House aides have also discussed the possibility of invoking the 14th Amendment, which could allow them to disregard the debt ceiling in the event of congressional inaction, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect internal talks. But the sources said that there are some in the administration who believe it could backfire, triggering lawsuits, scaring investors and raising the costs of borrowing.Yellen on Sunday did not explicitly rule out the move, but she said there are “no good options” — other than congressional action.Jeff Stein contributed to this report.The latest: Today, President Biden will meet with congressional leaders in an urgent bid to avoid a government default. White House officials see enormous risks in trying to resolve the debt ceiling impasse without Congress.Understanding the debt ceiling fight: Biden and the House Republican leadership are on a collision course over the national debt limit. Here’s when the debt ceiling battle could end.What is at stake? If the debt limit is breached, Biden warned that it could send the U.S. economy into a free fall. The debt ceiling breach could wipe out 8 million jobs, a recent White House analysis found. Amid consumer anxiety over the uncertainty, financial experts warn against making fear-based decisions.",

      "title": "Analysis | What the détente between Trump and a top antiabortion group suggests",
      "text": "If the 2024 GOP nomination process has begun to look like a coronation of Donald Trump, this event might epitomize it: A key antiabortion group this week suddenly signaled a more sympathetic posture to Trump, despite little indication that he has come to support the group’s position.About three weeks ago, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America offered a remarkable criticism of the former president. Trump’s campaign had said he agreed with the Supreme Court in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that abortion is an “issue that should be decided at the state level.” The group made clear in no uncertain terms that this wasn’t good enough.“President Trump’s assertion that the Supreme Court returned the issue of abortion solely to the states is a completely inaccurate reading of the Dobbs decision and is a morally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate to hold,” the group said.It added that supporting a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks was a must to earn its support. “We will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to embrace at a minimum a 15-week national standard,” it said.Late Monday, the group was singing a different tune and suggesting Trump had moved toward that position. But it’s hard to tell how.Its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, issued a statement after a meeting with Trump and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the leader of the federal effort to ban abortion after 15 weeks. This statement was laudatory, calling the meeting “terrific.”But the statement made no mention of whether Trump now supported a federal 15-week ban. The omission is striking considering that it did describe other positions Trump took on abortion, including:Asked whether Trump addressed a federal 15-week ban in the meeting, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America (SBA) spokeswoman Mary Owens simply referred to the same statement. Asked whether the group still considered the policy a must-have, Owens said: “Yes.”Trump has in recent weeks seemingly left the door ajar to supporting a federal 15-week ban. But he did so while offering one of his trademark nonspecific responses.“We’ll get something done where everyone is going to be very satisfied,” Trump said in New Hampshire. “I think we’ll get it done on some level, it could be on different levels, but we’re going to get it done. I know the issue very well. I think I know the issue better than most, and we will get that taken care of.”Some interpreted this as Trump saying he might sign such a federal ban, while others noted that Trump conspicuously declined to support such a ban.As the National Review noted after a conversation with Dannenfelser on Tuesday, the new SBA statement didn’t necessarily signal support for Trump. Dannenfelser disputed the Associated Press’s initial characterization that she had “aligned herself” with Trump.But it certainly cast him in a friendlier light than it did three weeks ago. The idea seems to be that Trump hued to SBA’s position somewhat by signaling support for rape, incest and life-of-the-mother exceptions in a federal ban. The conservative outlet labeled this “a softening of the position Trump’s spokesman had taken.”Whether it actually is a softening? Trump has supported these exceptions before. Perhaps you could say that his saying he would insist upon them in the context of federal legislation means he is now more open to federal legislation than his campaign’s statement three weeks ago indicated. But for a former president with a history of nonspecific, all-things-to-all-people responses, that would seem to be pretty thin gruel.It’s certainly something worth watching. The group’s remarks three weeks ago seemed to be a major statement of intent as it sought to apply real pressure on a former president who few in the conservative movement have dared to go after in such blunt terms. If antiabortion groups were suddenly going after Trump on this issue, it could complicate matters for him.Of course, if Trump is going to waltz to the nomination regardless, the group’s tactic has relatively little leverage. And we’ve seen plenty of times before how Trump’s hold over the GOP base can cause potential allies to set aside their principles. (It’s already happened with the antiabortion movement. Back in 2016, leading antiabortion activists including Dannenfelser said Trump “cannot be trusted” during the primaries, before she ultimately strongly backed him as the GOP nominee.)Trump clearly doesn’t want to touch this issue right now; we’ll see if he’ll actually be forced to.",

      "title": "Tom Cruise tells King Charles: ‘You can be my wingman anytime’",
      "text": "WINDSOR, England — In one of the more surprising moments heralding this country’s new sovereign, Hollywood royalty Tom Cruise assured actual royalty King Charles III that he could be his “wingman anytime.”The “Top Gun” actor’s message was among the highlights of Sunday evening’s concert celebrating the weekend’s coronation. Some 20,000 members of the public, ticket holders via a lottery, gathered with the royals on the grounds of Windsor Castle — the first time a concert has ever been held here. Many more watched on the telly at home.They enjoyed an eclectic mix of dance, music, spoken tributes and skits. And there were gasps from the audience during a dazzling drone show, which lighted up the night sky with the colorful outlines of a whale, lion, rabbit, flower and other images.During Cruise’s prerecorded sketch, a nod to Charles’s training as a jet pilot in his early 20s, the actor flew a small vintage craft through thick clouds. He addressed the new leader with a salute, a greeting that played on huge screens on the castle grounds.“Pilot to pilot, Your Majesty,” Cruise said, “you can be my wingman anytime.” (Fans hoping to see the actor materialize in their midst were disappointed.)Charles and Camilla watched the extravaganza from the royal box — probably a welcome change of pace from Saturday, when they were center stage. At one point, with Lionel Richie singing, the couple got up to dance.In the most emotional moment of the night, Prince William paid tribute to his “Pa” and said the late Queen Elizabeth II was “fondly keeping an eye on us; she would be a proud mother.”William also praised his father’s charity work and dedication to diversity and the environment. As he spoke, some in the crowd chanted: “You’re next, and you know you are!”The event was the lesser U.K. concert of the week. The city of Liverpool is hosting the Eurovision song contest, with its finale on Saturday. That concert could be watched by around 160 million worldwide, including Charles and Camilla, who revealed themselves to be Eurovision fans during a recent visit to that city.Back at this one, it was the likes of Take That — a beloved British band billed as pop “royalty” — that got the crowd going. “Downton Abbey” actor Hugh Bonneville hosted, kicking off things by saying that Charles has a lifelong passion for the arts. “He’s a painter,” Bonneville noted. “An artist. An artist formerly known as prince.”The range of artists reflected the king’s wide interests. They included the Chinese pianist Lang Lang, the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and Welsh Grammy winner Bryn Terfel. Performing together for the first time was a mega-wattage combination: the Royal Ballet, Royal Opera, Royal Shakespeare Company, Royal College of Music and Royal College of Art.But there was a lack of A-list British stars to give the concert extra oomph, and no moment was as memorable as the Paddington Bear sketch at Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee last June.“There wasn’t anything wrong with the performances per se,” wrote the Guardian’s music critic, Alexis Petridis. “But not even a spectacular light show, replete with illuminated drones hovering above Windsor Castle, could distract you from the sense that the show was cobbled together from what they could get.”Crowd gasps at the drones. #coronationconcert pic.twitter.com/1r4Y6RxBAiThe event was organized and hosted by the BBC, the taxpayer-funded broadcast entity that constantly panned to the royal box, where Prince George, 9, and Princess Charlotte, 8, were seen waving flags and swaying to the music.One of the standout acts was Katy Perry, who arrived onstage to sing “Roar” as drones formed the lion above Windsor Castle. Charlotte sang and her mom, Catherine, Princess of Wales, danced along as Perry belted out her signature hit. “Gawd bless Queen Katy Perry,” ran a headline in the Evening Standard.Perry attended the coronation on Saturday as well, wearing a large hat at Westminster Abbey and seeming to briefly struggle to find her seat. The moment quickly turned into a meme.The fans inside the palace walls were in a jovial mood — joining in loudly on the verses of “God Save the King” and soaking up the atmosphere with the majestic backdrop of Windsor Castle, a favorite home of the late queen.Paul Truesdale, a 45-year-old nurse, was there to cheer on his fellow choir members as they went onstage with the Coronation Choir, a group of amateur and community singers from across the country. “It’s a moment I’ll never forget,” he said.There’s still a bit more of royal festivities to come. Monday was made a bank holiday for the coronation and is being billed as the “Big Help Out,” a day when people are encouraged to volunteer in their communities.",

      "title": "Most U.S. adults say the abortion pill mifepristone should stay on the market, Post-ABC poll finds",
      "text": "Two-thirds of Americans say the abortion drug mifepristone, used in the majority of abortions in the United States, should remain on the market, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.The poll finds that 66 percent of U.S. adults say mifepristone should remain on the market, while 24 percent say it should be taken off the market. Just under half, 47 percent, say access to mifepristone should be kept as is; 12 percent say it should remain on the market but be more restricted than it is now.The drug is at the center of an escalating legal dispute. The Supreme Court preserved full access to mifepristone in April, putting on hold a lower court’s ruling that the Food and Drug Administration erred in making the drug more broadly available. This month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit will consider the case brought by antiabortion groups against the FDA’s regulation of mifepristone, a decision that will almost surely be appealed to the Supreme Court.Mifepristone is often taken in combination with misoprostol and is approved to at least some degree by 94 countries worldwide. The FDA has broadened access to mifepristone since it first approved it over 20 years ago, giving the go-ahead for at-home use.Nearly a year after the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, two-thirds of Americans say they oppose the decision to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion, including 54 percent who oppose it “strongly.” Opinions have stayed consistent, with more than half saying they were strongly opposed in three Post-ABC polls taken since September 2022.Strong opposition to the court’s decision overturning the right to have an abortion peaks among liberals (86 percent) and Democrats (82 percent). Strong opposition also extends to majorities of moderates (62 percent), women (61 percent) and independents (55 percent). And half of White Catholics strongly oppose the Supreme Court overturning Roe.About 8 in 10 Americans say the decision on whether to have an abortion should be left to the woman and her doctor (78 percent), while about 2 in 10 (18 percent) say abortion should be regulated by law.White evangelical Protestants are among the most supportive of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which nullified the Roe ruling, with 58 percent in favor. About 4 in 10 White evangelicals say mifepristone should be taken off the market (41 percent), while 50 percent say it should remain on the market, including 16 percent who say it should be allowed but be more restricted. At the same time, 56 percent of White evangelical Protestants say decisions on whether to have an abortion should be left to the woman and her doctor.Leaving the decision to have an abortion up to a pregnant person and their doctor is also a majority-held opinion across parties (including 58 percent of Republicans) and religious groups (including 74 percent of White Catholics).On the whole, opinions on access to abortion medication are closely tied to their support for the Supreme Court’s decision last year eliminating a constitutional right to an abortion. About 8 in 10 Americans who oppose the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision say mifepristone should remain on the market (81 percent), while 12 percent say it should be taken off. Among those who support the court’s decision overturning Roe, 53 percent say mifepristone should be taken off the market while 37 percent say it should remain for sale.A similar majority of people who say decisions about abortion access “should be left to the woman and her doctor” say mifepristone should remain on the market (77 percent), compared with 28 percent among those who say abortion should be regulated by law.A slim 51 percent majority of Americans say Supreme Court justices make decisions mainly “based on their personal political views,” while 39 percent say their cases are decided mainly “based on the law.” That marks a slight shift in views since before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, when Americans were roughly split on whether justices made decisions based on the law or their political viewpoint.Attitudes about the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion are closely tied to Americans’ skepticism that the court is impartial. More than half of those who say they approve of the court overturning the right to an abortion say they make their decisions based on the law (54 percent), while 59 percent of those who disapprove of the decision say they make case decisions based on their personal views.This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted over the telephone April 28 through May 3 among a random national sample of 1,006 adults with an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, with larger error margins among subgroups. In all, 75 percent of respondents were contacted by cellphone, while 25 percent were reached by landline.Scott Clement contributed to this report.Tracking abortion access in the U.S.: After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v.

      "title": "Perspective | The Wizards and Knicks GM Scott Perry: An ideal fit hiding in plain sight",
      "text": "The Washington Wizards need a general manager, and a few prayers also wouldn’t hurt. Once mired in mediocrity, they can’t even get past the bouncer now. Operating under an owner’s playoff mandate, they’ve endured five straight losing seasons, failing to be a postseason stowaway in four of them.If rebuilding is tough to stomach, how do you describe the indigestion of aimless losing? Their insufficient attempts to win have led to a farcical squandering of five years that could have been spent resetting the roster with better young talent, an abundance of future assets and ideal salary cap flexibility.And guess what? They could actually be winning now and holding leverage to build a stronger contender with the NBA bracing for a wild couple of offseasons as franchises adjust to parity-driven wrinkles in the new collective bargaining agreement.The Wizards aren’t seeking a new executive to lead their basketball operations simply out of a desire to win. Owner Ted Leonsis is on the hunt because the organization doesn’t know how to. Any blurry vision the Wizards have of steady, perennial contention — and we’re talking a much higher level than the John Wall-Bradley Beal era — requires an executive with the kind of team-building dexterity the franchise hasn’t seen since its 1970s heyday.As the playoffs progress without them, the Wizards are at the beginning phase of their process to replace Tommy Sheppard. They have a fluid list of candidates, and The Washington Post reported two intriguing executives who have had exploratory talks with the Wizards: Trajan Langdon, the New Orleans GM who is second to David Griffin on the Pelicans’ organizational chart, and Milwaukee Bucks assistant GM Milt Newton. Tim Connelly, the president of the Minnesota Timberwolves and a Baltimore native who turned down the Wizards four years ago, is considered a possibility again, even though he’s just one year into a deal that pays him $8 million per season. Golden State’s Bob Myers, who could be a free agent soon, will be every needy team’s dream for as long as he’s available.But considering the Wizards’ situation, there’s an ideal fit who should be among those pursued by Leonsis: New York Knicks GM Scott Perry. After Sheppard was fired, Post beat writer Ava Wallace mentioned Perry following conversations with people from around the league. Over the past few weeks, I’ve also asked around about what Washington should do, and Perry is consistently among the first names mentioned.Why? The reasons are as layered as the Wizards’ problems. Perry, 59, has spent the past 23 years developing a reputation as a multidimensional talent evaluator capable of matching the right players to a team’s identity, a versatile thinker who doesn’t view the task as merely contending or rebuilding and a connector with the skill set and personality to lead and be the glue for an organization.Those happen to be the Wizards’ three most essential needs. This roster, a collection of spare parts around Beal, has no identity. Leonsis, always methodical, has begun his search with an open mind but is unlikely to be moved by candidates who prefer a teardown — especially if they can’t envision other fruitful paths. The front office needs a shift in culture and a boost in spirit after what several holdovers have portrayed as a tense and sometimes coarse work environment over the past few years.Similar to Langdon, Perry could be enticed by the opportunity to be the top basketball executive. It took until 2017, when New York called, for Perry to be given true No. 1 responsibilities. But in 2020, the Knicks fired team president Steve Mills and later replaced him with former agent Leon Rose, who oversees basketball operations. Perry and Rose have worked well together. The Knicks, in the middle of a conference semifinal series against the Miami Heat, have made the playoffs in two of the past three seasons. They have a solid and fiscally responsible roster, with Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle providing all-star-caliber production on tolerable contracts. They have the trade assets and flexibility to go fishing for a superstar if the right one becomes available. Instead of relying on their brand and their city as the only attractions, the Knicks are starting to look desirable for their competence. That’s the Perry effect, even when he doesn’t have final say. He did some of his best work with Joe Dumars in Detroit, helping to shape a roster full of underappreciated, tough and unselfish pros who made six straight Eastern Conference finals and won a title in 2004 over a Los Angeles Lakers team featuring Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Gary Payton. He spent a year with the Seattle SuperSonics before the team relocated to Oklahoma City, helping Sam Presti with a draft that included snagging Kevin Durant and trading Ray Allen to start a rebuild that propelled the organization to a long run of contention.Perry also has worked for Orlando and Sacramento. He was with the Kings for just three months before the Knicks offered that dream opportunity, but during that short tenure he was critical to a formative offseason that included drafting De’Aaron Fox, who has blossomed into the franchise player of a promising young team.Leonsis knows the Wizards need a fresh approach. They also need a new vibe. Those initial talks with Langdon and Newton should help crystallize what’s possible. Perry is just as worthy of consideration.Leonsis famously declared that he spoke with 78 leaders from sports, business and politics before making several hires and restructuring the Wizards four years ago. Well, that was a fun exercise. Now they’re on to the next thing. To replace Sheppard, the process will be streamlined, and it needs to be fast with the June 22 draft approaching. It needs to find someone who can marry long-standing knowledge of NBA team building with current best practices, all while mixing in the agility to maneuver swiftly should franchises react erratically before luxury tax penalties become more punitive.Over the past five seasons, the Wizards have gone 161-229, a .413 winning percentage. That’s basically the equivalent of a 34-48 record every year, almost tank-level bad without the benefits of tanking. The Wizards haven’t drafted higher than ninth during this period. They’re probably picking in that same territory in this draft; they have the eighth-best odds to land the No. 1 pick in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.This is how stuck they are: In 2018-19, the Wizards went 32-50, making them one of 14 teams to win fewer than 40 games. Nine of those 14 teams made the playoffs this season. The Wizards went 35-47.Trying to lose is unethical. But trying to win this way — with Beal on a $250 million deal with a no-trade clause, Kristaps Porzingis making more than $30 million per season and ready for an extension and free agent Kyle Kuzma probably seeking $25 million annually — is absurd. The Wizards are desperate for someone with an itemized plan for success.When Perry came to the NBA in 2000, Dumars was recasting a 32-50 team still reeling after losing Grant Hill in free agency. A year later, the Pistons won 50 games and started a streak of eight straight playoff appearances. It was a run in which Dumars and his front office nailed almost every decision.That’s the environment into which Perry was born, and everywhere he has been, he has shown portions of that team-building acuity. It leaves you wondering what he could do with full control over a substantial period of time. The Wizards would be wise to find out.",

      "title": "Advice | What to do with your money as Congress debates lifting debt ceiling",
      "text": "People are scared that the debt ceiling showdown will end up slamming them financially.And they are right to be alarmed. Republicans are risking pushing the nation into default and disrupting the global economy.“I am more worried about the debt ceiling not being raised than anything else in life at the moment,” wrote Jana Hutchins of Tempe, Ariz. “I have been retired for about a year and a half, and I have a long time to go to live on the savings I have accumulated over my lifetime. I fear it could be wiped out or so severely reduced that it will take more time to recover than what I might have.”Debt ceiling breach could wipe out 8 million jobs, White House warnsThe debt ceiling restricts how much money the federal government can borrow to pay its bills. And while it is gravely concerning that the government spends more than it takes in, this recent conflict is about spending that has already been approved.“It’s unfortunate that Congress is playing a game of chicken with so much at stake,” said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar. “But we’ve been here before, in 2011, and that time, at least, Congress managed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling at the 11th hour. It seems unlikely that Congress won’t do so this time around, but anything is possible, especially with the extreme polarization in Washington right now.”Consumer confidence is important right now, with the Federal Reserve still battling inflation and concern about a potential recession ahead. Then there were the spectacular failings of several major banks. Nearly half of Americans are anxious about the safety of the money that they have at banks or other financial institutions, according to a Gallup poll conducted in April, the month after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed.I wrote about this issue earlier in the year, but now that the deadline for a deal is closing in, I thought it was important to address the anxiety people are feeling. I reached out to readers, asking how they felt about the looming debt ceiling crisis.“To say that I am feeling stress over the disastrous possibilities is an understatement,” wrote a disabled veteran from Indianapolis.See how the national debt grew to $31 trillionJeff Leonhardt, a retired public school teacher in Michigan, wrote: “I have a pension but also have savings, bonds, and mutual funds. It worries and angers me that the public has to endure the shenanigans of the people who supposedly work for us.”For many consumers, the political grandstanding doesn’t make economic sense.Scott Helmers of Spirit Lake, Iowa, wrote: “As a retired person, I fear both for Social Security and government bonds. But moreover, I worry about the country’s reputation. The situation is a matter of paying our commitments. It is a total representation of the instability of government for a succeeding Congress to refuse to pay for bills passed by the prior Congress.”Investors with U.S. savings bonds are contemplating cashing in, fearing the government will default. One reader with Series I savings bonds asked whether it makes sense to move that money to certificates of deposit that yield close to 4 percent.If you want more personal finance advice that's timeless, order your copy of Michelle Singletary's Money Milestones.Stop.Don’t make a move based on fear. Pause and consider what the following financial experts recommend. Here’s what you should and shouldn’t do.This debt ceiling drama may culminate in hair-raising last-minute deals, but don’t make rash decisions, warned Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner who founded the fee-only Life Planning Partners, based in Jacksonville, Fla.To answer the question of the I bondholder wondering whether she should sell, the experts agree. Don’t do it.“We go through this every few years, and it generally gets worked out,” McClanahan said. “CDs aren’t any safer than I bonds, so if that is the reason she is switching, it isn’t worth the hassle.”Series I savings bonds are still ultra-safe. They also offer valuable protection against inflation you don’t get with CDs, Benz said.How to prepare financially in case of a debt ceiling crashIt’s also important to remember that if you have owned your I bonds for less than five years, you forfeit the last three months of interest.Investors “would lock in a guaranteed loss in an effort to avoid a possible, and in my view, still unlikely, loss,” McClanahan said.Finally, given the volatility that the debt ceiling chaos may create for stocks, you should hold on to your bonds, said Russell Price, chief economist for Ameriprise Financial.In the unlikely event there is a default, investors might rush to bonds because the stock market will probably see a significant drop, Price said.“Initially, the safer investments might be fixed-income securities,” he said.Fleeing when you are fearful is a natural response. But in this case, it would be unwise.There’s a low probability the government will default, but if you jump out of the market, you might see losses if, at the last moment, Congress increases the debt ceiling, Price said.“People shouldn’t be making significant adjustments,” he said. “They shouldn’t be overreacting.”Instead, play the long game if you’re an investor.“This kind of brinkmanship and uncertainty often cause volatility in stocks, which is why I like the idea of people having at least a 10-year spending horizon if they want to own them,” Benz said. “That way, even if stocks go down and stay down for a while, you won’t risk having to touch them when they’re depressed.”Banking news, stock market lurches got you jittery? Here’s some adviceMake sure you have a good emergency fund to weather any short economic upheavals, McClanahan said.Yes, you’ve heard this before. And yet we know many Americans don’t have enough saved for a financial emergency.“I like the idea of retirees and other people with short-term spending needs holding true cash instruments for their very short-term needs,” Benz said.Four money rules when financial news is making you nervousInterest rates are rising, making debt more expensive. A default could make things much worse.“The most important thing you can do is make sure you are as debt-free as possible,” McClanahan said.If there was ever a time to embrace diversification, this is it.You need cash, bonds and equities to help you weather this debt ceiling storm and any other economic calamity.In addition to a rainy-day fund, Benz recommends having a mix of high-quality bonds — including government, corporate and mortgage-backed securities — that cover your short-term and medium-term spending needs from three to 10 years out.If you have a personal finance question for Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary, please call 1-855-ASK-POST (1-855-275-7678).Recession-proof your life: The tsunami of economic news is leading consumers, investors and would-be homeowners alike to ask whether a recession is inevitable.

      "title": "Disney expands lawsuit to include new DeSantis-backed legislation",
      "text": "The Walt Disney Co. on Monday expanded its lawsuit alleging retaliation by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to include new regulations passed by the state’s legislature that allow officials to nullify development agreements brokered by the entertainment giant.DeSantis (R), who is weighing a presidential run, signed legislation Friday giving the special board that oversees government services in and around the Walt Disney World Resort the authority to void existing contracts.The law disallows any Florida special district from complying with a development agreement executed within three months of any separate law modifying how board members are selected.Disney, in an amended legal complaint, said the legislation signed Friday was drafted to solely target its development.“Governor DeSantis and his allies have no apparent intent to moderate their retaliatory campaign any time soon,” Disney’s complaint reads.Disney’s lawsuit, originally filed in late April, alleged that the governor was attempting to punish the company for its opposition to the Parental Rights in Education Act, which prohibits lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools through the third grade.1/5After Disney denounced the legislation — which critics dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill — the Florida legislature at DeSantis’s urging passed a measure to seize control of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The 39-square-mile jurisdiction that includes Disney World has special privileges that allow it to maintain its own utilities, infrastructure and public safety services and impose its own taxes.DeSantis and the state legislature abolished that district — whose commissioners were senior Disney executives — and established a new one with commissioners appointed by the governor.But before the outgoing commission was dissolved, officials signed a new contract with Disney that restricts the new board’s ability to regulate the region. It also included a clause that extends the agreement until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III of England.In the amended complaint, Disney — which is Florida’s largest employer and reported $82.7 billion in 2022 revenue — invoked statements DeSantis made to reporters on Friday about new law.“This all started, of course, with our parents’ rights bill,” the governor said.DeSantis, who has still yet to officially declare his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race, trails former president Donald Trump for the Republican nomination by 29.1 percentage points, according to a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll.",

      "title": "Analysis | What Trump’s Many Legal Troubles Mean for His 2024 Campaign",
      "text": "Former President Donald Trump embarked on another White House run while facing a slew of legal troubles, which thus far have produced a felony indictment and, most recently, a jury’s verdict that he is civilly liable for sexual assaulting a woman. The cases could bring further distractions and produce more unflattering revelations — not to mention adverse verdicts — that no presidential candidate would welcome. Trump is no normal politician, though, and the legal scrutiny could feed his preferred narrative that he is being unfairly targeted by the current Democratic administration and a “deep state” bureaucracy. 1. What was Trump indicted for?Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. He stands accused of concealing payments on the eve of the 2016 election to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, intended to keep her from going public with her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump. The case asserts that records of the Trump Organization were falsified as part of a scheme to violate election laws. Trump denies the affair and pleaded not guilty on April 4, the day the indictment was unsealed. Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, a key player in the alleged scheme, admitted he facilitated payments and was reimbursed by the Trump Organization for advancing the money to Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges and other violations in 2018 and was sentenced to three years in prison. Cohen implicated Trump in his plea — which referred to Trump as “Individual-1.”2. What’s the status of other possible criminal prosecutions?• The FBI said it found 11 sets of documents bearing classified markings at Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, a number of which were marked top secret. In their search warrant, agents said they were investigating a potential violation of the Espionage Act — which makes it a crime to remove or misuse national-defense information — along with obstruction of justice and violation of a law prohibiting the removal or destruction of government records. Days after Trump announced his candidacy, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith, the former head of the Justice Department’s public integrity section, as special counsel to take over the probe.• Smith is also overseeing a Justice Department inquiry into whether Trump or people tied to him instigated the violent attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was certifying the results of the 2020 election. The Democrat-led House of Representatives committee that investigated the Capitol riot voted on Dec. 19 to recommend that the Justice Department charge Trump with insurrection and other crimes — though such criminal referrals from Congress carry no legal weight on their own. Republicans have since taken control of the House.• In Georgia, Atlanta District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating whether Trump broke the law in his attempts to alter the results of the state’s 2020 vote. In a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call, Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” him 11,780 votes — one more than Joe Biden’s margin of victory in the state. A special grand jury that heard evidence in the case finished its work by submitting a report to Willis, who says her decision on whether to bring charges will be announced sometime between July 11 and Sept. 1. The foreperson of that special grand jury, in media interviews that Trump’s lawyers condemned, said the panel’s recommendations included indicting more than a dozen people, and she hinted that Trump was among them.• On Dec. 6, following a weeks-long trial, two units of his family business, the Trump Organization, were found guilty of engaging in a 13-year tax-evasion scheme. A Manhattan jury found the two units guilty of all 17 counts including scheme to defraud, conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. Trump himself wasn’t charged. The two companies were assessed a $1.6 million fine. With a felony on its record, the Trump Organization could be barred from further contracts with government agencies and could have trouble doing business with banks. Lawyers for both units said they would appeal.3. Could any of this disqualify Trump as a presidential candidate?Most likely not. Article II of the US Constitution, which lays out qualifications for the presidency, says nothing about criminal accusations or convictions. Trump opponents see two possible avenues to challenging his eligibility, however. One is a federal law barring the removal or destruction of government records: It says anyone convicted of the offense is disqualified from federal office. This could conceivably apply if — and this is a big if — Trump is charged and convicted for taking classified documents from the White House. The other is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. It says nobody can hold a seat in Congress, or “any office, civil or military,” if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion.” Two advocacy groups have said they would sue to try to make sure the 14th Amendment prohibition applies to Trump.4. Where do the civil cases stand?• In a case brought by New York advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, who said Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s, a jury on May 9 found Trump liable for battery. The suit was filed under New York’s new Adult Survivors Act, which lifted the statute of limitations for one year on civil claims for sexual offenses. The jury also sided with Carroll’s claim that Trump had defamed her when, in 2019 after she made her allegation, he said she was “not his type” and that she made up the claim to boost sales of her book. The jury awarded Carroll a total of $5 million in damages.• A civil suit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump and three of his children is perhaps the biggest threat to the former president’s wealth, as well as his image as a successful businessman. It accuses them and their real estate company of fraudulently manipulating the value of assets for years to deceive banks and insurers. James is seeking $250 million in disgorgement and a permanent ban on the four Trumps doing business in New York. She’s already succeeded in winning a court order for an independent monitor to oversee the Trump Organization, a move that could bring unprecedented scrutiny to the former president’s finances.• Trump, his company and his three oldest children are also facing a class-action lawsuit filed in 2018 by four investors who claimed that they were duped by Trump’s promotions into paying thousands of dollars to become independent sellers with ACN Opportunity LLC, which sold a doomed videophone device that Trump touted as the next big thing. The devices were made obsolete by smartphones. Trump sat for questions in October.• Trump was sued by 12 Democratic lawmakers accusing him of sparking the Jan. 6 riot. Multiple Capitol police officers also sued Trump for physical injuries and racist abuse suffered during that day. Through appeals, Trump is trying to get the cases dismissed.• Mary Trump, the former president’s niece, sued her uncle, his late brother and older sister for allegedly cheating her out of her share of the family fortune. Donald Trump won dismissal of the lawsuit on Nov. 14; Mary Trump is seeking to have it reinstated.• A group of Michigan voters sued Trump and his reelection campaign in 2020 for mass voter suppression, particularly among Black voters. Trump’s attempt to dismiss the case was partially granted; the Michigan group sought more time to file a second complaint.5. Do these cases hurt him politically?In polling that has remained remarkably steady, roughly 53% of Americans say they view Trump unfavorably compared with 43% who view him favorably. He continues to hold a substantial lead among Republican voters as their pick for the 2024 nomination. A recent Economist/YouGov poll showed that views of Trump’s legal travails largely align with how people view him more generally. Offered the basic outline of the hush-money charge, without Trump’s name attached, poll respondents overwhelmingly agreed that it’s “a crime for a candidate for elected office to pay someone to remain silent about an issue that may affect the outcome of an election.” But when the question was rephrased to be specifically about Trump, just 15% of Republicans called it a “very serious” issue, compared with 53% of Democrats. Trump has long tried to cast lawsuits against him and investigations into his conduct as politically motivated, calling them “hoaxes” and “witch hunts.”--With assistance from Zijia Song.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "title": "Advice | Work Advice: My boss talks everything to death",
      "text": "Reader: I’ve had a new boss for about six months who means well but is the epitome of “this meeting could have been an email.”He goes over the same things multiple times, tells me his vacation schedule when I have access to his calendar, and messages me asking things he should be able to figure out himself. Yesterday I asked him for something from a system I don’t have access to. He called me over to his desk to explain his thought process and showed me some unnecessary stuff before finally sending me what I asked for.Basically he likes to hear himself talk, needs his hand held, and thinks I need mine held as well, and it’s become overwhelming. I like to keep to myself. I feel like he doesn’t respect my time. I’m having a hard time finding a balance between respecting my boss and setting boundaries. Any advice?Karla: What you’re dealing with is at the heart of every return-to-office versus remote-work power struggle right now. On the one hand, you’ve got the process-focused, let’s-talk-this-out collaborator; on the other, a leave-it-to-me-I’ve-got this problem solver. Both have their place and purpose, both are valuable, and both will inevitably be paired up and drive each other bonkers.Your power dynamic makes things tricky. When the person you report to is the person impeding your progress, you have to tread carefully. Failing to mask your impatience, or rationing your responses to his half-considered queries in the hope he’ll find his own answers, could be perceived as disrespectful and uncooperative.Some reasons your boss may feel the need to confabulate everything to death:And finally:Work Advice: Dealing with an employee who is too good at his jobI realize that I’m doing the same thing as your boss, rattling on about clock design when you just want to know the time. But if one of the above explanations clicks with your sympathies, it may help defuse your annoyance. Replacing “he doesn’t respect my time” with “he can’t help himself” can put you in a better frame of mind when you try to gently rein him in, as follows: After he cycles through an explanation, repeat it in a condensed form, and then say, “I think I have the gist. How about if I start on it and get back to you at [future time] with a status update and any questions I have?” Translation: I hear you, I understand what you want and I’m eager to get started on it.After you’ve repeated this process a few times and delivered your usual great results, your boss should, ideally, start to trust that you know the work and are best left to do it. Eventually, you may get to the point of being able to head off his filibusters with a bright “Yep, got it.”That is, of course, assuming he’s capable of change and can pick up on feedback without taking offense. If he truly does value the sound of his own voice over results, there may not be much you can do to make working with him tolerable.Work Advice: Strategic incompetence demands a strategic responseAs for his habit of asking needless questions, think of the following scenario as an example of how not to handle it.Reader: I was on a contract with a team of 60 or 70 people in a client’s large facility, including “Rachel” (also a contractor) and “Lisa” (an employee of the client, same rank as Rachel and me).One day I needed to discuss something with Rachel. The only other person in the room was Lisa. I said, “Lisa, do you know where Rachel is?”Lisa said, “She’s there.”“Where is ‘there?’”“Where would she be?”Finally, after I’d asked eight or nine times, Lisa vaguely motioned toward an office off the room we were in and said, “She’s in that office.”Lisa had clearly known where Rachel was all along and held out on me for no apparent reason. Even if she had a valid reason for not telling me where Rachel was, the appropriate response would have been, “She’s unavailable,” not a bunch of evasions. After the incident I made a mental note that if I ever needed to find someone who was out of the room, I wouldn’t ask Lisa. Do you have any insights on this exasperating situation?Karla: I can imagine any number of motives behind Lisa’s uncooperative response: She didn’t like you; she was distracted; she had been asked all day where other people were and was tired of being used as a personal tracking service. Whatever her reasons, the power dynamic leaned in her favor as a full-time employee, so there wasn’t much you could do about it.In any case, you learned that Lisa is not a helpful resource, and you’re better off relying on yourself. Mind you, if conveying that lesson was her goal, she could have saved you both a lot of frustration by pleading total ignorance.Reader query: Are you a talk-it-out collaborator, or a leave-me-alone-I’ve-got-this problem solver?

      "text": "Why Eric Dickerson beaming at a gold Pontiac Trans Am he was gifted in 1979 by the largesse of Texas A&M boosters to play football for their Aggies is not among the greatest sports photographs is beyond me. Is it too dark? Too grainy?After all, it is one of the few photos to capture what until recently was one of the greatest, if not notorious, traditions in all of sports: four wheels as illicit currency to secure the services of a college sports star.So paint me underwhelmed at the news that former Maryland basketball star Angel Reese, now known also as Bayou Barbie, tweeted last week about a Mercedes-Benz EQS 580 — which retails at roughly $130,000 — that was gifted to her by a dealership near LSU, where she transferred her talents last season, gifted her. It was for her 21st birthday and, undoubtedly, for delivering the Tigers a national championship last month. Good for Reese, of course. She deserves it.But the practice is permissible now. There’s no longer any disingenuous NCAA regulation against so-called extra benefits for college athletes, which forever read something like “any special arrangement by an institutional employee or a representative of the institution’s athletics interest to provide a student-athlete [or a student-athlete’s relative or friend] a benefit that is not generally available to other . . . students and their relatives and/or friends or is not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation. This includes but is not limited to the use of a car.”But with the new name, image and likeness regulations, which allow college athletes to cash in on their celebrity, the beneficiaries can now freely share photos of themselves with the public, admiring their endowed new whip, as Reese did. Car-for-play no longer taunts jeopardy or pokes the bear, as a onetime basketball player named Dillon Brooks uttered before he was mauled. It doesn’t generate rumors like, if memory serves me, that silver Chrysler Cordoba with a Terps-red vinyl roof that John Lucas rolled around College Park in during the first half of the 1970s while starring for Maryland’s basketball and tennis teams. A teammate of his told me recently that Lucas’s ride wasn’t procured unscrupulously but by Lucas’s dad. Oh well.There is no longer the audaciousness of hiding in plain sight. The thrill is gone, the threat of sanction assuaged.Kansas wasn’t so lucky even after one of the greatest college basketball players was gone from Allen Fieldhouse and in the NBA. Someone found out and decided to tattletale to the NCAA that some Jayhawks boosters gave Wilt Chamberlain a “plush red,” some said, 1956 Oldsmobile when he played there. The NCAA responded in 1960 by putting Kansas basketball on probation for two years. It wasn’t allowed to play in any postseason tournaments except the Big Eight’s.If there is one thing NIL gets right, it is that it allows the laborers to make some financial deals on the side as well, particularly with car dealerships for which the coaches toil to cut deals for low-cost or no-cost rides fresh off the lot. It has just taken the conniving out of it all.The NCAA case files are full of car-for-play schemes from coast to coast — South Carolina men’s basketball, Cincinnati men’s basketball, Auburn men’s basketball, Arizona State football, Nebraska football, Ohio State football — and all the way to Hawaii.The saintly John Wooden had his team pinged by the NCAA in the early 1970s after a booster arranged “for a person to co-sign a ‘Security Agreement and Promissory Note’ dated May 15, 1970, in the amount of $1,767.12 in order for a then prospective student-athlete to borrow money to purchase an automobile.”Before the unsaintly Rick Pitino became the persona non grata in college basketball he should be, he was part of a coaching staff at Hawaii that swapped basketball tickets with a local dealership for cars for players. The program was slapped with two years of probation, and Pitino, who the NCAA said lied about it, slinked into hiding for a year before resurfacing at Boston University.Even little University of Mary Hardin Baylor had to vacate its 2016 Division III football national title because its coach at the time was discovered to have lent his wheels to a couple of players. The players’ identities were protected — probably because the car was a 10-year-old Subaru.Dickerson long denied the tale of his Trans Am. He held it was a gift from his grandmother — until his memoir, “Watch My Smoke: The Eric Dickerson Story,” was published last year.“I mentioned to my stepdad in passing that I really liked the new Pontiac Trans Am,” Dickerson recalled as an 18-year-old, “ … the bird on the hood, the fins on the side, how sleek it was. It was an innocent comment. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have remembered even saying it. But recruiting isn’t a normal circumstance, and before I knew it, I was talking to [Clarence] Shear, the big A&M booster in town. ‘We can make that happen, he said.’“Then he told me to go to the dealership, and all of a sudden I’m there with my mom and my grandma, then the staff is telling me to pick any car on the lot. I had my pick of a Corvette and three Trans Ams: black, silver and gold. I liked the gold one.“The dealership guy said he’d be right back, that he just had to make a phone call. When he returned, he gave my grandma the paperwork to fill out. But behind the scenes, A&M had agreed to reimburse her.”Dickerson signed with SMU instead — and didn’t return the Trans Am. For three seasons, A&M paid its note as Dickerson carried the football in Dallas. And several years later, A&M was put on probation.The good ol’ days are gone.",

      "title": "Past debt ceiling debates carved up federal spending and derailed a presidency",
      "text": "When President Biden summons congressional leaders to the White House on Tuesday for talks to raise the federal debt limit and avoid a catastrophic default, the negotiations will join a Washington tradition going back almost 40 years of lawmakers and the president haggling over fiscal policy as the nation’s solvency hangs in the balance.Past negotiations have netted substantial spending reforms and helped doom a presidency. But all have averted a default, a prospect that Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said would cause “economic chaos” and could hurl global markets into a deep recession.Biden has demanded that Congress increase the debt ceiling — the amount the United States can borrow to pay its bills — without preconditions. The Republican-controlled House, pushed by GOP hard-liners, has signaled instead that it will use the impasse to force steep budget cuts to a range of programs, including social services, and roll back some of Biden’s signature legislative achievements.Previous presidents and Congresses have faced similar deadlocks. Here’s how they played out.With Congress and President Ronald Reagan locked in a fight over the annual budget, Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), Warren Rudman (R-N.H.) and Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) floated a solution. Congress would increase the debt ceiling while putting the federal government on a path to balance the budget in the near future.Congress and the president would have five years to rein in borrowing, and in the absence of a deal, automatic across-the-board cuts to federal programs — called “the sequester” or “sequestration” — would snap into place.The legislation drew wide GOP support, though some foreign policy hawks opposed the measure because it did not carve out military spending. A Pentagon spokesman said the bill gave “comfort to the Soviets,” even after Reagan publicly said he supported the measure.Democrats were split on the idea, but even some fervent liberals, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (Mass.), supported it. Social Security, Medicaid and other core entitlements were exempted from the cuts. The bill ultimately passed with wide bipartisan backing.But Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, as the law is known, immediately became an object of scorn. It encouraged brinkmanship, lawmakers said, while leaving Americans and financial markets in suspense. The effects of automatic cuts could be fast and consequential, throwing an unstable economy into a recession if the spigot of federal dollars instantly shut off.Then-Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Calif.) likened Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to “leaping into a black hole, and we don’t know where we’re going to land.” Yet he voted for the bill.Hollings later renounced the legislation that bears his name. “After four years in a shotgun marriage called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings,” he wrote in a 1989 New York Times editorial, “I’m filing for divorce on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences.”Facing impending sequestration cuts, President George H.W. Bush summoned congressional leaders in September to Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland to hash out a budget deal.The setting was supposed to be more summer camp than board room, with the goal of breaking political deadlock in a relaxed atmosphere. Lawmakers took over the base’s Officers’ Club. Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) arrived with his pet schnauzer and a baseball bat labeled “The Big Budget Stick,” The Washington Post reported, a gift for the president.The talks produced a breakthrough, but not without damning political consequences for Bush. He agreed to a deal that capped discretionary spending, reformed entitlements and set the government on a path to a balanced budget within five years. But in exchange, he supported a tax increase on the wealthiest earners, reneging on his famous campaign declaration: “Read my lips, no new taxes.”In a national address, Bush issued an impassioned plea to Americans to tell their representatives to support the deal. Instead, Congress rejected it, then passed a similar proposal weeks later that Bush signed. It raised the top tax rate by 3 percent and curtailed some tax deductions, while capping the tax rate on capital gains.By that time, the federal government had already been forced to shut down temporarily, and Bush was politically wounded for breaking his most memorable campaign promise. He lost reelection in 1992.President Barack Obama appointed former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles and Republican former senator Alan K. Simpson (Wyo.) to lead a bipartisan group to address the federal budget. But this commission had unique power: If a supermajority of the members voted to approve the recommendations Bowles and Simpson drafted, the proposals would go to Congress for an up-or-down vote.The co-chairs proposed that the government cut $3 in spending for every $1 in new revenue collected, raise the Social Security full-benefit retirement age to 69 by 2075, restrain defense spending and raise taxes on the wealthy while eliminating certain middle-class deductions.The report, which aimed to reduce the nation’s deficit by $4 trillion over a decade, won the support of a majority of the commissioners, but it fell short of the supermajority needed to advance it to Congress. Legislation introduced in 2012 based on the Simpson-Bowles recommendations was soundly defeated.The failure of Simpson-Bowles, in part, led to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which brought the country back from the brink of a first-of-its-kind default.Part of that legislation called for the establishment of another commission to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The bipartisan “supercommittee” was made up of members of the House and Senate and imbued with power similar to that of Simpson-Bowles. A proposal that won the support of a majority of members would advance to Congress for a vote. Without a proposal or other congressional action, automatic sequester cuts — an idea first introduced by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings — would kick in.Democrats proposed a $3 trillion savings package with revenue from new taxes and savings from Medicare. Then-Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) countered with another package that would cut spending, constrain inflation-related spending increases and limit certain tax breaks.The supercommittee rejected both proposals and did not advance a plan. Budget cuts on discretionary spending from the sequester ultimately took effect in March 2013 and expired at the end of the federal government’s 2021 fiscal year.The latest: Today, President Biden will meet with congressional leaders in an urgent bid to avoid a government default. White House officials see enormous risks in trying to resolve the debt ceiling impasse without Congress.Understanding the debt ceiling fight: Biden and the House Republican leadership are on a collision course over the national debt limit. Here’s when the debt ceiling battle could end.What is at stake? If the debt limit is breached, Biden warned that it could send the U.S. economy into a free fall. The debt ceiling breach could wipe out 8 million jobs, a recent White House analysis found. Amid consumer anxiety over the uncertainty, financial experts warn against making fear-based decisions.",

      "title": "Analysis | Why are these groups so much more likely to wear glasses than any others?",
      "text": "Writing from Lodi, Italy (which is not far from Milan), reader Brenda Philips asks: How many people wear glasses? And, more importantly, why are spectacles so spectacularly ubiquitous these days?For now, we’ll assume Brenda’s inquiry is utterly innocent and unrelated to the dorky man-turtle whose image peers out from the logo of this column.The simple answer is that about two-thirds of American adults wear some kind of glasses or contacts. According to our analysis of more than 110,000 responses to the National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Census Bureau on behalf of the National Center for Health Statistics, 62 percent of respondents said they donned some form of corrective eyewear in a recent three year-period.But we’ve got bad news for Brenda: That answer is not as definitive as it sounds.For starters, it probably doesn’t cover everybody who wears frames or sunglasses because they look awesome, or because they’ve boarded the blue-light bandwagon, or for any other reason not related to vision correction.Moreover, eyewear is not evenly distributed even among seemingly similar groups. The ubiquity of eyeglasses in your personal universe will change depending on whether you’re hanging out with young legal workers (ages 25 to 39) or your friends who work in agriculture or construction. That’s because the legal workers are more than twice as likely to wear glasses.What’s actually going on here? If good vision is hereditary, as we assume, how could your occupation determine your need for vision correction?As we cast about for an answer, we ran into a minor obstacle: the entire field of ophthalmology. It turns out the eye is excruciatingly complicated, people spend their entire lives studying it, and some frazzled columnist and his database aren’t going to crack this question wide open in just a week.For help, we called eye-data expert Bonnielin Swenor, director of the Johns Hopkins Disability Health Research Center. Swenor pointed us to her friend and colleague, Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute pediatric ophthalmologist and researcher Megan Collins, who appears to know everything about eyeballs.Collins pointed out that the simple survey question we’re using — “Do you wear glasses or contact lenses?” — covers a host of underlying conditions, from astigmatism to eyestrain to I-want-people-to-take-me-seriously-itis. But to keep it simple (perhaps overly so) we’ll focus on two common conditions: myopia and presbyopia.Myopia can strike young: Folks who start wearing glasses as children or teens are often correcting myopia, otherwise known as nearsightedness. For people with myopia, nearby objects appear clear, but distant objects blur.Presbyopia strikes old: It hits almost all of us in our forties or later, reducing nearby objects to maddening blurs while farther-away objects remain clear. (It comes from the Greek word presbys, roughly meaning elder. And yes, it shares that root with presbyterian, a type of church led by elders.)What’s behind the curse of presbyopia? As Collins explained, the lens in our eye gets stiffer and less flexible with age, a trend some of us can absolutely relate to. Since the muscles in the eye can’t bend the hardened lens to focus as easily, our eyeballs’ zoom function stops working so well. Soon, we’re squinting at screens and holding the restaurant menu half a mile (0.8 kilometers) from our faces. That’s when we wind up with reading glasses, one of those goofy magnifier headsets or — if we already have glasses for myopia or another condition — bifocals.Data shows the presbyopia-driven wave of glasses use starts rising around age 40 and doesn’t level off until people near age 60. If we wanted a variable that best defines middle age, we could do worse than the onset of presbyopia. (That’s a killer column idea. What other factors define middle age? Let us know!)But myopia is the condition more relevant to Brenda’s question about the increasing popularity of glasses. Because it turns out that, yes, myopia is on the march.In a 2009 JAMA Ophthalmology publication, National Institutes of Health ophthalmologists found that the prevalence of myopia had increased from 25 percent of the population age 12 to 54 in 1971 and 1972 to 42 percent of people in that age range in 1999 to 2004. The study was based on thousands of physical exams conducted for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.That, of course, raises more questions. Kids’ genes couldn’t have changed that much since the 1970s. So why are so many more of them myopic?Swenor and Collins explain that while kids may not have changed, the world around them sure has. And key changes in the way kids grow up — many associated with urban living and consumer technology — have been hard on the eyes.Myopia typically hits because your eye stretches out while it’s still growing. A myopic eyeball is elongated like an alligator egg, which causes light bent by the lens to hit in front of the retina’s rods and cones instead of directly on them. So you can read the ingredients on a can of refried beans without help but may require glasses, contacts or a monocle to clearly see your Aunt Jill grilling loin chops across the yard.Researchers keep finding new factors that may be linked to your likelihood of developing myopia, and while nothing’s settled yet, a couple factors keep rising to the top. According to a review of myopia research, and Collins, spending time outdoors is one of the best things a kid can do for healthy eye growth. Though Collins also reminds kids to protect their eyes with a hat or sunglasses while they’re out there. (She also recommends eating plenty of leafy greens, for the record.)Outdoor light may help your eyes grow, and being outside gives your eyeballs more opportunities to flex their muscles by focusing on distant objects. While data is surprisingly scarce, available evidence suggests kids may spend less time outdoors than they did a generation or two ago.“We know that for children to reach their full potential — to experience truly healthy development — spending regular time outdoors in unstructured play is essential,” Laura Mylan of the national nonprofit Children and Nature Network told us. “And we’ve lost that in today’s world.”Myopia has risen even more rapidly in East Asia, where countries have attempted sweeping remedies. A program in Taiwan, for example, encouraged students to participate in two hours of outdoor activity every day. After it began in 2010, researchers found in the journal Ophthalmology, Taiwan’s long rise in myopia went into reverse. (Props to Vox’s Christophe Haubursin, whose video first taught us about this study.)More recently, vision tests from almost 125,000 children in eastern China showed that myopia increased when they were confined to their homes during the coronavirus pandemic — especially among younger children ages 6 to 8, according to an analysis in JAMA Ophthamology.Another likely driver is more time spent doing near work such as studying, reading, working on the computer, or even watching television. Not only do such activities require you to focus on close objects, but they also typically take place indoors.People also are more educated today, and many studies find that the more education you have, the more likely you are to be myopic. That correlation, of course, is probably related to the first two factors: To get a diploma or degree, you’ll probably spend more time indoors studying.Education gaps often accompany much of the difference in myopia — and thus the glasses gap — among groups: Women are more likely to wear glasses than men. High earners are more likely to wear glasses than low earners. And Asian and White Americans are more likely to wear glasses than their Black and Hispanic compatriots.We don’t have geographic data on glasses, but models from the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (the product of a partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and NORC at the University of Chicago) show residents of the least-educated states are actually among the most likely to have serious eye problems that aren’t corrected by glasses, which Swenor said can include eye conditions that result from uncontrolled diabetes. West Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas and Kentucky all rank at the bottom in both vision issues and share of adults with a bachelor’s degree.The CDC group also has produced county-level estimates of serious vision loss, using insurance claims and medical records, as well as county, state and national demographics. Education was not included, but again the less educated areas seem to face more dire vision issues.Of course, myopia is not the only reason a more-educated person might be more likely to wear glasses. “There are a number of other factors that may be at play too,\" Collins said, “including cost of eyeglasses, access to vision care, health literacy, or trust in the health-care system.” More educated Americans are also more likely to be doing jobs that require near work, such as typing or reading, and thus more likely to don reading glasses to compensate for the slow advance of presbyopia.While myopia is an easily corrected annoyance for many of us, Swenor says its rising prevalence is also a bona fide public health issue. When the eyeball elongates, the stretching can damage the wall of your retina and cause permanent, non-correctible vision loss such as myopic macular degeneration.Swenor lives with this condition herself and has broadened her work to campaign for data that she hopes will shed light on the inequities faced by Americans with disabilities of all kinds.“Data on disability is lacking in many spaces. It’s not collected in the same way we collect data on race, ethnicity, and gender identity,” Swenor told us. “And because we don’t have that level of data, it really removes the opportunity to identify and address the inequities that people with disabilities face, which are just as profound as for other oppressed groups.”Hello! The Department of Data turns your curiosity into columns. What do you wonder about: Which states have the most children named after Christianity’s 12 apostles? Who’s most likely to own their home free and clear? Who spends the most on alcohol? Just ask!If your question inspires a column, we’ll send an official Department of Data button and ID card. This week’s button goes to Brenda, of course!",

      "title": "Banking stress emerges as major concern for financial stability",
      "text": "Banking sector stress has shot up as a concern for stability in the financial system, according to the latest Federal Reserve survey on major risks to the economy.As inflation has eased over the past year, troubles at midsize banks emerged as a top concern among market analysts, business leaders, academics and researchers consulted by the Fed, especially in the wake of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. Those banks collapsed in part because of their overreliance on uninsured deposits, poor risk management and their failure to account for the risks of rising interest rates — hazards that policymakers now see have the ability to trigger broader panic.“Despite decisive actions by the Federal Reserve, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation], and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, concerns about the economic outlook, credit quality, and funding liquidity could lead banks and other financial institutions to further contract the supply of credit to the economy,” the report read. “A sharp contraction in the availability of credit would drive up the cost of funding for businesses and households, potentially resulting in a slowdown in economic activity.”The uncertainty tied to rising interest rates in other countries, geopolitical tensions and the possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt were also cited in the Fed’s biannual survey.The report comes as markets and the broader economy are still rattled from this spring’s banking crisis, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank triggered financial panic. Earlier this month, First Republic became the third U.S. bank to be seized by regulators in the past two months. Stocks at a handful of regional banks are still taking a beating. And all over the country, small businesses are feeling banks pull back on lending, hampering their ability to invest and plan for the future.More regional bank stocks slide, but deposits aren’t fleeingIt’s too soon to tell how much more the economy will suffer. Officials at the Fed expect growth will slow as credit conditions tighten in ways that mimic a rate hike, making it harder for people and businesses to get loans. But they don’t yet know how significant that pullback will be, or if their aggressive rate hike campaign to tame inflation will send other shock waves through the financial system — or even cause a recession.Also on Monday, a new Fed survey on bank lending practices underscored that lenders expect to tighten loan standards even more in the near future, including for commercial real estate loans.“Banks most frequently cited an expected deterioration in the credit quality of their loan portfolios and in customers’ collateral values, a reduction in risk tolerance, and concerns about bank funding costs, bank liquidity position, and deposit outflows as reasons for expecting to tighten lending standards over the rest of 2023,” the survey said.The initial banking crisis is easing. Another may be around the corner.Last week, shares of PacWest Bancorp plummeted after the company issued a statement overnight saying it was in “ongoing” discussions with partners and investors. Western Alliance also saw its stock price tumble. Shares at both banks recovered in Monday trading, and the firms say their deposit totals are on solid footing. But Wall Street analysts are still wary that other midsize banks — especially those with high proportions of uninsured deposits — are not adequately prepared for a possible downturn, or an extended period when rates stay higher for longer.Through it all, financial regulators are sticking to the message that the banking system is strong. At a news conference after the Fed raised interest rates again last week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said conditions in the banking sector have “broadly improved” since regulators launched a major rescue campaign to stave off broader contagion, adding that “we’re committed to learning the right lessons from this episode.”Fed raises rates by 0.25 percentage points in what could be final hikeLate last month, the Fed released a scathing report on the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and regulators’ own culpability, that now sets the stage to toughen the rules for midsize banks again. The Fed’s top banking cop, Michael Barr, is spearheading that push.Meanwhile, House Republicans and the White House are still at an impasse over the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department has warned that the U.S. could default as early as June 1 if the debt limit isn’t raised by then. Powell has consistently said the borrowing cap needs to be raised, and has warned that a default would threaten financial stability.",

      "title": "Bud Light has managed to unite the left and right in anger",
      "text": "Bud Light, America’s most popular beer, has managed to anger just about everybody.Belinda Mendoza manages Dragster, a queer bar in Seattle that caters to the kind of customer Bud Light was hoping to court with its recent partnership with trans actress and influencer Dylan Mulvaney. But when the brand failed to stick up for Mulvaney after her Instagram ad provoked conservatives’ calls for a boycott, Mendoza says it was an easy decision to stop carrying products from Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brand’s parent company. AB InBev’s beers weren’t all that popular with her customers, she said, and the company “has never really aligned with what I believe in.”AB InBev is in damage control mode as it seeks to squash the backlash from the Mulvaney partnership; the company is planning to triple its U.S. marketing spending over the summer, according to reporting from Ad Age. It’s also offering free cases of Bud Light to wholesale employees, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, and is assuring consumers it “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people” according to a letter from CEO Brandon Whitworth.Bud Light’s bid for inclusion has barely dented the brand’s market dominance. AB InBev said on an earnings call last week that declines in the first three weeks of April, as uproar mounted, represented only a 1 percent drop in its global sales volumes. But the magnitude of backlash shows the risk brands face in trying to expand their customer base — especially when doing so puts them in the crossfire of the culture wars.Todd Evans, president and CEO of Rivendell Media, which specializes in queer marketing, said that Bud Light’s about-face in its partnership with Mulvaney made the situation worse, creating a case study of “what not to do.” The company’s first mistake, Evans said, was kicking off the effort to expand its audience “in an open digital environment where anything can go anywhere” rather than with a traditional, targeted ad.“Bud Light remains the number one brand in the U.S. nationally in volume and dollar sales,” Anheuser-Busch said in a statement to The Post. In an earnings call last week, AB InBev’s CEO Michel Doukeris told investors the company believes it has the “experience, the resources and the partners” to manage the controversy that has followed the Mulvaney partnership.Other big companies like Levi’s and Disney have faced backlash in the past for courting queer markets, Evans notes, but calls for boycotts have fallen flat when the companies involved have stood by their marketing efforts. Bud Light is struggling, Evans said, because “they took a stand and didn’t stand behind it.”If Anheuser-Busch InBev had said, “We stand on the side of equality,” Evans said, the opposition “probably would have died there.”Bud Light’s sales are currently down 3 percent for the year, compared to the same period last year, according to data from Bump Williams Consulting. Case sales slumped 8 percent in the same time frame, said founder and CEO Bump Williams. Bud Light has been trying to alter its image. In a podcast released in March, Bud Light’s vice president of marketing, Alissa Heinerscheid, said that the brand is “in decline” and expressed a need to evolve its “fratty” identity into something more inclusive and appealing to younger consumers.When Heinerscheid pondered how the brand might change, she aimed for “a campaign that’s truly inclusive and feels lighter and brighter and different and appeals to women and to men,” she said on the “Make Yourself at Home” podcast. Amid the uproar over the partnership with Mulvaney, Heinerscheid and her boss were placed on leave.Bud Light started that rebranding effort with a March Madness-related clip that Mulvaney posted to her Instagram, in which she showed off a can of beer bearing her likeness that AB InBev had sent her to commemorate a year since her transition to womanhood. The blowback was swift and noisy — but not altogether surprising, given how much the move departed from Bud Light’s long-standing identity, according to Cary Cooper, professor of organizational psychology at the University of Manchester and a scholar with the Academy of Management.“They’re trying to make sure they don’t lose either of these demographics,” Cooper said. “I don’t know if that’s going to be very effective.”In an interview with the Financial Times, AB InBev CEO Doukeris blamed the hit to Bud Light on “misinformation and confusion” online about the extent of the brand’s partnership with Mulvaney, which left some consumers under the impression that “every can would be like the one that was in that post.” Others thought the can commemorating Mulvaney marked the start of an official Bud Light campaign.“We never intended to make it for general production and sale for the public,” Doukeris told the FT. “It was one post. It was not an advertisement.”Bud Light’s partnership with Mulvaney touched a nerve at a time when anti-transgender legislation is on the rise across the country. In 2023, Republican state legislators have advanced dozens of pieces of legislation seeking to restrict transgender people’s access to health care, sports and public accommodations, and prohibit the ability to change a person’s name or gender on a driver’s license or birth certificate.Transgender Americans experience stigma and systemic inequality in many aspects of their lives, according to a wide-ranging poll from The Washington Post and KFF. In the survey, 63 percent of transgender adults reported that they “sometimes” or “frequently” feel discriminated against because of their gender identity or expression.Mulvaney did not respond to a request for comment from The Post. As uproar to her Bud Light ad mounted, the influencer took a break from social media. She addressed the situation for the first time in an Instagram video April 27, nearly a month after the backlash began. She didn’t mention Bud Light by name, but said recent events had practically “killed the people-pleaser” in her and expressed frustration with the ways she’s been dehumanized.“I’ve always tried to love everyone, you know, even the people who make it really, really hard,” Mulvaney said.",

      "title": "Analysis | The real reason trucks have taken over U.S. roadways",
      "text": "Rhode Island has fallen. The trucks have taken over. The Ocean State was the last bastion of majority-car culture, the final holdout against a rising tide of trucks, a category that includes pickups, vans and SUVs.The revolution happened fast. From the time the Federal Highway Administration’s registration data began in 1900 until the late 1980s, cars ruled the nation’s roadways. But in 1989, the trucks claimed their first state, Alaska. A trickle of trucky states in the Mountain West and Northern Plains followed, but most states didn’t turn truck until after the Great Recession, when crossover utilities conquered the suburbs.The truck tidal wave appeared to crest in 2012, when more than a dozen states flipped, but that was probably a reflection of earlier trends: In 2011, the Federal Highway Administration updated its sources, definitions and methods to more accurately track trucks, which include pickups, SUVs, vans, crossovers and, in this case, commercial and government vehicles.Even after that update, a few East Coast states held out. But New York became minority-car in 2014; Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey then toppled in rapid succession. The last domino fell in 2018, when even the roads on Rhode Island’s islands became stuffed with trucks. (Despite the seeming ubiquity of the Honda Odyssey minivan, D.C. is still majority car.)Why did the truck takeover snowball? A simple and true explanation would be that America has unusually cheap gasoline and many people find bigger vehicles to be more convenient.But an even more true explanation might be that colossal car conglomerates with colossal advertising and lobbying budgets have strong incentives to sell us light trucks, the definition of which can fluctuate.As a rough rule of thumb, cars typically have two rows of seats and a trunk or hatchback, while light trucks are typically built on a truck chassis. Or, in the case of many crossovers, they’re built on a car chassis with special features added for off-roading.Whether a vehicle is classified as a car or a truck is, therefore, subject to some interpretation. For now, the important point is that trucks generally are more profitable than cars thanks to two big government incentives, both of them historical footnotes.The first is the so-called chicken tax, a 25 percent tariff imposed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 on foreign-built work vehicles as part of a chicken-related trade war with Europe. If you’re making a pickup or cargo van in the United States, profits should be higher, because foreign factories can’t come close to undercutting you on price.The second incentive lies in the fine print of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards adopted in 1975, Gerald Ford’s reluctant response to a crippling Middle East oil embargo that sent gas prices soaring. To protect American commerce, work trucks and light trucks were subject to less-strict CAFE standards than family sedans. Trucks are also exempt from the 1978 gas guzzler tax, which adds $1,000 to $7,700 to the price of sedans that get 22.5 or fewer miles to the gallon.Those incentives encouraged American car manufacturers to double down on trucks. But the CAFE standards also had a more subtle and far-reaching effect: They pushed carmakers to broaden the definition of truck.“Cars and light trucks had two different standards. It became easier to meet the standard with trucks. So automobile manufacturers thought of ways to basically build trucks that are really cars, and that’s what generated the SUV,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Christopher Knittel, who has spent much of his career tracing the unintended consequences of government fuel regulations.A half-century ago, if you needed to haul 3.5 kids, hamburger buns and a standard poodle, car companies would happily sell you a station wagon, and you’d be counted on Team Car.Today, if you show up with the same cargo needs you’ll be steered toward a crossover SUV — an eerily similar vehicle serving an eerily similar purpose, but one that comes with a few extra bells and whistles that just so happen to allow manufacturers to classify it as a “light truck,” regardless of whether it’s actually well-suited to off-roading or hauling. Now you’re on Team Truck.“They’re responding to the definition, for regulatory purposes, of what a light-duty truck is,” Knittel told us. “If they can, they’ll make a small tweak to a vehicle and get it to be classified as a light truck, even though the vehicle itself hasn’t changed at all.”In fact, if you look at the list of SUVs on fueleconomy.gov, maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, you will see something genuinely mind-bending: The Toyota Corolla Cross 4WD. By some incredible alchemy, and by at least one definition, a variant of the Toyota Corolla — the archetype of a frumpily efficient family sedan — has evolved into a light truck.“Corolla represents the entry point to the Toyota lineup,” Toyota’s Ben Haushalter said via email. “As customer tastes change over the years, our strategy of offering varied body-styles within the Corolla brand has changed accordingly.”Virtually all the growth in trucks has come not in pickups or vans, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency, but in SUVs, a category now led by the mushy middle of crossovers-that-probably-should-have-been-station-wagons.The truck transformation’s environmental toll comes with an asterisk. Thanks in part to rising CAFE standards and tightening truck definitions, data shows that fuel economy has actually improved. In 2021, the typical new SUV got about 24 miles per gallon — about the same as the average sedan in 2007. Our friend the Corolla Cross gets 30 miles per gallon, a benchmark its self-effacing sedan forebears couldn’t meet just a decade ago.America’s fuel consumption peaked in 2004, during the 12-mpg-Ford Excursion era defined by ultralow gas prices and ultra-big SUVs. Fuel consumption has since fallen, according to the Federal Highway Administration, even as the light-truck share of the market has roughly doubled. But over the past decade, as SUV adoption has soared, that progress appears to have stalled.Meanwhile, manufacturer profits aren’t the only thing pushing us toward SUVs. Drivers, too, face incentives — 4,500 pounds of them — every time they pull onto the highway. That’s how much the average new light truck weighed in 2021, which is about 1,000 pounds more than the average sedan or wagon.The profusion of taller, heavier vehicles changes the road-safety equation, Knittel told us, making their drivers safer and people in smaller vehicles less safe. Design changes and technological advances have narrowed the gap, but large vehicles remain safer than their petite peers. That may help explain why SUV adoption has accelerated. It’s a feedback loop: As cars get larger, everyone feels pressed to buy a larger car.And it’s not just other drivers who suffer in this mobile arms race. Pedestrians and cyclists are increasingly imperiled on roads dominated by trucks. Nearly 7,400 pedestrians were killed in 2021, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the highest figure in four decades, and preliminary estimates from the Governors Highway Safety Association show 2022 could be even worse.“We’ve made cars safer and safer for people in them, but as we have done that, we’ve made it increasingly less safe for people outside of them,” said Rebecca Sanders, founder of Safe Streets, a pedestrian- and bicyclist-safety specialty firm headquartered in Portland, Ore.The peril posed by supersized pickups has been well chronicled. But while regulators are racing to promote technology-assisted safety measures, even a crossover can be more dangerous than a sedan, Sanders told us. It’s physics: The extra weight of a small SUV dumps more kinetic energy into a human body upon impact, and hits that body at a higher point, leading to more serious injuries.“If you were to be hit by a sedan, you’d likely be hit in the leg, maybe pelvis for a school-aged child,” Sanders said. “But today’s gargantuan trucks will hit an adult in the chest or even the head. And even the crossover will be more likely to hit your pelvis or belly, where your vital organs are located.”Hello! The Department of Data thrives on your quantitative curiosity.

      "title": "Analysis | What’s the Debt Ceiling, and Will the US Raise It?",
      "text": "The very phrase “debt ceiling” sounds austere and restrictive, as if it’s a lid on government spending. In fact, this cap on US government borrowing affects only the ability to pay existing bills, not to approve more spending. But it has become an explosive political issue with the potential to roil financial markets, since a failure to raise the ceiling could eventually result in a first-ever default on some of the government’s obligations. With time running short, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning of “an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making,” the debt ceiling has become a subject of political brinkmanship.1. Where do things stand?The US is getting perilously close to the current federal debt limit of nearly $31.4 trillion, at which point it could lose the ability to meet all payment obligations. Yellen says that moment — the X-date, as it’s known — could arrive by June 1. Since mid-January, her department has been using so-called extraordinary measures — such as withholding regularly scheduled contributions to a federal employee retirement fund — to keep paying debts and delay the reckoning. Once those measures are exhausted, the options get more dire.2. What would be so bad about a default?A wide variety of people and entities owed money by the US government would face what normally is unthinkable — being stiffed (at least for a while) by Uncle Sam. These include Social Security recipients, members of the military, families with children, Medicare providers and holders of Treasury securities. There could be a partial government shutdown. Failure to pay bondholders would have cascading effects, with credit rating agencies downgrading Treasury debt, leading to higher borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households. The US economy “would quickly shift into reverse, with the depth of the losses a function of how long the breach lasted,” according to the Council of Economic Advisers, part of the White House. “A protracted default would likely lead to severe damage to the economy, with job growth swinging from its current pace of robust gains to losses numbering in the millions.” Just getting too close to the debt ceiling, as happened in 2011, could affect the US’s credit rating and hurt consumer confidence.3. Why is there a debt ceiling?Its creation, in 1917, made it easier to finance World War I by grouping bonds into different categories, easing the burden on Congress to approve each bond separately. With World War II looming in 1939, Congress created the first aggregate debt limit and gave the Treasury Department wide latitude on what bonds to issue. Raising the ceiling lets the government borrow to cover the gap between spending and taxes already approved by Congress. 4. When did it become a political issue?The limit was routinely raised without incident until 1953. That year, approval was held up in the Senate in an attempt to restrain President Dwight Eisenhower, who had requested an increase to enable construction of the national highway system. The limit has since been raised dozens of times, usually without a fight; both parties agreed to hikes under Republican President Donald Trump without a fuss, for instance. But the past quarter century has seen the debt ceiling increasingly become a partisan weapon. Raising the debt ceiling was among the disputes that caused two shutdowns of the federal government in late 1995 and early 1996. Another fight occurred in 2011,  prompting Standard & Poor’s to issue the first-ever downgrade of the US government’s credit rating. Consumer confidence plummeted as did poll ratings for Republicans in Congress and then-President Barack Obama, who agreed to more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over a decade to end the crisis. A second debt-ceiling faceoff between Obama and Republicans, in 2013, resulted in the cap being suspended for the first time.5. Who wants to raise the debt ceiling?Leaders of both major political parties acknowledge that the debt limit must be raised, because the gap between government spending and revenue is so large. But Republicans, who took control of the House of Representatives on Jan. 3 and blame high inflation on spending during President Joe Biden’s first two years in office, want to pair a debt limit hike with spending cuts. On April 26, House Republicans passed a bill that would raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion in exchange for $4.8 trillion in budget deficit cuts over 10 years. Speaker Kevin McCarthy has called that bill — which on its own stands little chance of passing the majority-Democratic Senate — an opening offer that he is willing to use to strike a deal with Biden, who has said that raising the debt ceiling is non-negotiable and shouldn’t be conditioned on any other action.6. Does there have to be a debt ceiling?Some budget experts and commentators want to abolish the debt ceiling, arguing that the periodic congressional battles over it increases economic uncertainty. A variety of ideas to circumvent the limit have been rejected by previous administrations, including minting platinum coins and placing them in the Federal Reserve, or declaring the debt limit a violation of the 14th Amendment prohibition on questioning federal debt. One idea that has gotten more attention in recent years would be for the Treasury to issue premium bonds. By offering much higher interest rates, investors would bid up the bonds, providing cash to the government but shrinking the face value of the debt for the purpose of evading the debt limit. Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have insisted, however, that Congress must act. --With assistance from Erik Wasson.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "It wasn’t supposed to happen this way for the team that led the NHL wire-to-wire, breaking records for success in the regular season.But Presidents’ Trophy winners have a habit of falling short in the Stanley Cup playoffs, and the Boston Bruins are the latest team to be eliminated in the first round, left stunned Sunday night by a 4-3 overtime loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 7 in Boston. The defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche experienced the same stinging deflation hours later in Denver, being eliminated, 2-1, by the second-year Seattle Kraken in another winner-take-all game.The Bruins were well aware of what was at stake, with winger Brad Marchand telling ESPN in March: “If you win the Presidents’ Trophy but you don’t win the Cup, nobody cares. That’s what we know on this team.”As offseason arrives, the Capitals prep for daunting challenges aheadEven the Panthers, who roared back from a 3-1 deficit in the series and forced overtime on a goal by defenseman Brandon Montour with a minute left in regulation, were in disbelief at the monumental accomplishment of having beaten the most successful team in NHL history, one that set records with 65 wins and 135 points.The Panthers have done the unimaginable 😱@FlaPanthers | #TimeToHunt pic.twitter.com/Ts42aUT8HE“It hasn’t sunk in yet,” forward Matthew Tkachuk told reporters. “The talent they have over there in Boston is unbelievable. That we were able to do what we did after what they did all year … the fact that we were able to beat them in the playoffs is crazy.”The end came on a goal by Carter Verhaeghe 8:35 into overtime, when Tkachuk screened Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman. The win sends Florida to a second-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs, who eliminated the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday for their first playoff series win since 2004.“I guess the words that come to mind right now are disappointment and confusion,” Bruins Coach Jim Montgomery said. He also used the word “stupefying.”At least the Bruins have company, thanks to a Presidents’ Trophy “curse.” Since the trophy was first awarded to the team with the best regular season record in the 1985-86 season, only 11 regular season champions have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals, with eight winning. Since the wild-card format came into being in 2013-14, no Presidents’ Trophy winner has advanced to the finals. The Panthers, last year’s Presidents’ Trophy winner with 122 points, perhaps had extra insight about the Bruins after losing in the second round of last year’s playoffs to Tampa Bay.“They had a crazy regular season,” Verhaeghe said, “but the playoffs are completely different. I mean, we had a crazy regular season last year, and it really didn’t amount to anything.”Colorado was also on the wrong end of history Sunday night, sent home with a loss in which the Kraken became the first team to eliminate the defending Stanley Cup champion in its first playoff series. Colorado has lost its past six Game 7s.“Within the group, we believe in ourselves,” Seattle forward Oliver Bjorkstrand, who had both Kraken goals, told TNT. “It’s been like that all series. … We knew what we had to do to come in here and win the game.”",

      "title": "Fifty years after his Triple Crown, Secretariat remains an immortal wonder",
      "text": "PARIS, Ky. — Consider this timeline of a Kentuckian and a horse: Walker Hancock joined us on Earth in mid-August 1989 and Secretariat left us Oct. 4, 1989, so they coexisted for all of 52 days. Hancock apparently slept through Secretariat’s funeral, according to a well-placed source (his mother). “I hopefully wasn’t crying,” he said, “or I would have been escorted out.”Yet as a routine of Hancock’s presidency nowadays at Claiborne Farm, where he grew up and Secretariat lived the last 16 of his 19 years, humans of certain ages approach Hancock as if aching to share their stories of a nonhuman whose 33-year absence has burned with his abiding presence. “They saw him break his maiden,” Hancock said. “They saw him lose. Or they saw his last race. They all have a memory, and it’s so distinct, too. What the weather was …”Or consider this timeline of a Kentuckian and a horse: Jaime Corum joined us in November 1973, a week and change after Secretariat’s 21st and final race and 16th and final win at Woodbine near Toronto. Even as she became a “total horse person” and an equine artist, she never did meet Secretariat, a youthful oversight she regrets.Yet as a function of the fact she has painted him double-digit times upon various canvases, including on a Woodford Reserve bottle honoring the 50-year mark since Secretariat’s Triple Crown, Corum found herself on a hydraulic lift in pretty little downtown Paris, transforming the side of a building into a Secretariat mural that qualifies as striking, dwelling behind the day-to-day sights of a main street. With the bottle and the mural, she said: “I couldn’t believe how much my life was tied to Secretariat. I keep telling other people he’s taking me this year on this wonderful ride.” It has led her to brand Secretariat a unifier of people and say: “He’s one of those things that people always respond to. He’s timely, I think — in the year 2023.”How Secretariat does still romp through the human consciousness, 50 years after his Triple Crown win of 1973, and 33 years after his death from a hoof disease in 1989, and 13 years after the movie starring Diane Lane as owner Penny Chenery in 2010. All this time later, he’s prompting a mural, a fresh sculpture, a fresh city park and a parade, all coming to Paris by November to mark the 50-year mark of his relocation to Claiborne Farm, whose stallions have sired six of the 13 Triple Crown winners (including Secretariat).Of all the people who might take a whack at how this could persist, no one deserves a chance more than Paris-based veterinarian Robert Copelan, who oversaw the healing of one of the more famous abscesses in mammal history, the harrowing one that fell off Secretariat’s upper lip days before the Derby 50 years ago right about now.Copelan, 96, can retell for the umpteenth time the moment-to-moment that led to the eventual bursting of that painful devil that made a little noise as it fell to the straw, and only a boor would refrain from hearing again the gripping details. He also can remind you that seven horses beat Secretariat in four different races, all in the state of New York. He can remind that some people who know their racehorses go ahead and use the term “the greatest” for, among others, Flightline, the 2022 Breeders’ Cup dominator. Yet in pegging Secretariat’s deathless appeal, he said: “I’m not surprised at that. You know, he went to the Belmont and he won off by 23 lengths, 24 lengths” — eventually, 31 lengths — “and that froze in a lot of folks’ minds. They’d never seen anything like that.”That might stand tallest amid the bouquet of reasons. It might even epitomize how memory works. Watching that day by television, Copelan thought, “Well, this is going to make a lot of racket.”He got that right.For retired thoroughbreds, a Kentucky farm offers a serene final furlongAbout 12,000 people per year visit Claiborne Farm, and everyone agrees most do so foremost to see Secretariat’s gravestone among the 23 in the handsome and understated little cemetery. Some cry. Some place pennies atop in honor of Chenery, who died in 2017 at 95.As a stallion manager and a maestro at the separate art of tour-guiding, Joe Peel explains the privacy fence, built soon after Secretariat’s arrival not by plan but by reaction to the gawkers and would-be patters who kept parking on the road out there. He recites Secretariat’s still-standing records in the Kentucky Derby,  the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. He spreads knowledge, from, “Horses once could climb trees,” to, “Always remember to approach a horse from the left side,” to, “A person can make a nice horse mean,” to, “They’ve got a lot of teeth in their heads.” He shows the barn and stall in which Secretariat lived, nowadays inhabited by Runhappy, whose owners, Hancock pointed out, bought the horse inspired in part by the movie, well, “Secretariat.”“Routinely every year, this is part of their vacation trip,” Peel said of the tourists. “The come by and cry by at the headstone.” He paused. “They love him.” He paused again. “They love him. And you just step away and let them do their thing.”A deeply green little drive away at Paris’s Chamber of Commerce, they’re steeped in the 50 years from the various and telling perspectives in one office lobby. Betty Ann Allen says, “Oh, my husband [Jerry] worked out there when Secretariat came, and he was his groom, and people are, like, ‘Oh, can we take a picture with you?’ ” Lauren Biddle, who hadn’t yet joined us when Secretariat raced or lived, says, “I just didn’t know that Secretariat affected people emotionally the way he did.” Allen, referring to Secretariat’s awareness of his stardom: “My husband said he was the pose-iest horse he’d ever seen.” Biddle: “My 4-year-old daughter, she is now a fangirl of Secretariat.” Allen: “The [donors] that touch your heart are the ones that send $6. … It brings tears to your eyes but also gives you goose bumps.”Just down the way at the singular Lil’s Coffee House, where Copelan dines daily, the restaurant owner knows some things about Secretariat-mania, not just because it’s about to give her business another happy jolt. At her bed-and-breakfast on Rosecrest Farm, she and husband Charles have a Secretariat grandson, Tinner’s Storm.“Oh, my gosh, there are so many Secretariat crazies,” Lyra Miller said. “In fact, I’ve got two staying at my bed-and-breakfast, checking in today. One’s from Illinois, one’s from North Carolina, and it’s because they met online talking about Secretariat.”Two more were inbound from Rhode Island.“I have people that come to my B&B from all over the country, just because they want to see a grandson of Secretariat,” Miller said. She lists a few reasons this could be true — the Triple Crown, the unbroken records, Chenery’s charm — and says: “So I think it’s like a Michael Jordan, whose tennis shoes just sold for $2 million. Every sport has that personality who epitomizes that sport.”Then she says, “People talk about him like he’s still living, because in their mind he is a live presence.”She has seen the generations convene at the breakfast table, those who lived during and those who hadn’t joined yet, and she notes how the latter group often relies on the movie, so if a younger moviegoer might note, “He wins every time,” she gently might correct, “Yeah, it’s a movie.”That same convergence of people has decorated the insights of Tom Nieman, overseer of the design of the new park. He taught landscape architecture at the University of Kentucky for 39 years, remaining non-retired even as he doesn’t teach. He has helped numerous horse farms avoid the pratfall often stated as, “You can’t have a million-dollar horse in a ten-cent landscape.”In one of those life stories that make life stories, a man who taught at Syracuse in 1973 and felt no meaning from seeing Secretariat on the news back then has wound up calling this Secretariat project “a riot that’s been one of the major highlights of my career,” all while something has struck him. “The people who are putting this together,” he said, “the original group putting this together, are not horse-farm owners, they’re not horse-farm people. They’re people who put up fences, and do landscape work, and live in town. … None of them, as far as I can tell, actually are in day-to-day horse-farm operations.”So he said of people, in general: “They want to be close to or with someone who was the greatest. And I really think Muhammad Ali and Secretariat have a lot in common in that sense.” Corum, the mural painter, thinks it still matters that Secretariat’s “conformation was perfect” as “this ideal horse,” as “this gorgeous, fiery-chestnut horse.” She thinks it matters that Chenery engaged with fans as “a perfect gentlewoman.” She thinks the records help him outshine future Triple Crown winners, but then it comes back to that old stretch: “And of course, that Belmont. That’s otherworldly. I cry every time I watch that race. I just find it tremendously moving. … Even in athletics, in sports, it’s rare to see something on that level.”Five Kentucky Derby contenders to watch (and a few to avoid)So people did approach sometimes as she painted, with strokes of help from others such as Miller, who delighted in saying, “I got to paint part of one sock.” Corum said, “If they got to meet Secretariat or touch him or feed him a carrot, some little story, it was so impactful for them,” and she repeated a line attributed locally to photographer Bobby Shiflet at the Frames on Main shop: “He is kind of an Elvis.”And so, “It never gets old having a stranger tell me their Secretariat stories,” said 33-year-old Walker Hancock, who lived 52 days on Earth with Secretariat. “It’s just awesome that they want to share that experience with me.” That’s before he says, as an aside and a telltale line: “Obviously, I wasn’t around.”",

      "title": "Analysis | Lamar Jackson became the highest-paid player in NFL history his way",
      "text": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. — For more than a year, Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens were separated by a negotiating table and united in defiance. Jackson navigated the rarefied business of franchise quarterback contracts acting as his own agent, a decision widely viewed as naive at best and destructive at worst. Ravens officials consistently affirmed their commitment to Jackson even when league insiders predicted a dissolution and the quarterback himself requested a trade. Each marched undeterred into a gale of doubt.On Thursday afternoon inside the Ravens’ headquarters, Jackson walked to a dais wearing a green polo and a gold chain, his hair in curls spilling over the sides of his head, rather than his usual braids. Ravens General Manager Eric DeCosta and Coach John Harbaugh walked alongside him. They spoke for 33 minutes and answered dozens of questions. Their message, had they so chosen, could have been abridged to four words: I told you so.Earlier on Thursday, Jackson signed the contract that made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, a deal agreed to after stretches of acrimony that included his March trade request and the Ravens granting him the ability to seek offers from other teams. It ended with a $260 million contract, $185 million of it guaranteed, and the Ravens knowing their iconic quarterback will remain at the center of the franchise for five more years. It was an unconventional process for an athlete who has long chosen profound faith in himself over convention.“I really didn’t do this to prove anyone wrong or really care about what anyone had to say,” Jackson said. “If anything, I proved myself right. … I know what I’m doing. I feel like I did the right thing.”Jackson operates less on rebelliousness than on self-belief. Each week during the standoff with the Ravens, another agent’s number popped on his cellphone. He never knew how they had acquired his number. They would offer to represent him and boast about their client lists and the big dollars they had secured. “Man,” Jackson said Thursday, reminiscing about the interactions. “I do not care about your client.”“I wouldn’t put my trust in anyone else but myself,” Jackson said.Brewer: A year after Wilson trade, the Seahawks are still themselvesIt has been that way for Jackson and his family since his childhood. His mother, Felicia Jones, refused to speak with college recruiters who wanted to make Jackson a wide receiver. She screamed over the phone at a college coach after she learned her son had fielded a punt in practice.Jones raised Jackson and his three siblings by herself in South Florida. She trained Jackson in football, leading him on sprints up high hills and on sandy beaches. She demanded he not get a job to help with bills so he could focus on football.“This woman’s a superhero to me,” Jackson said.“Every time I was with him, his mother would be FaceTiming,” Brandon Radcliff, Jackson’s college teammate, once said. “They were like best friends. It was kind of weird to see how they gelled. They were more like friends. They would talk about everything. She just always kept him level, kept him the same. She would always keep it real.”Jones has served as Jackson’s manager for his entire career. She is intensely private, and her lack of a public profile has contributed to criticism. When Jackson agreed to the contract, he did not treat himself to anything extravagant — “for now,” he said — but he did buy his mother a gift, a sign of his appreciation.“I feel like she managed me very well,” Jackson said. “Don’t you think so?”Jackson described his internal process during negotiations as “just me and her piggybacking off each other.” Jackson dealt with the Ravens himself, almost always in direct one-on-one conversations with DeCosta.“We always didn’t agree necessarily, or we would have gotten a deal done a lot sooner,” DeCosta said. “But the respect has always been there. The appreciation has always been there. … I was dealing with Lamar Jackson the agent — impressive, patient, demanding, honest, straightforward. It wasn’t always easy. I’d rather deal with Lamar Jackson the player.”Jackson developed a rule for himself: Keep your emotions out of business. He announced he had asked for a trade moments before Harbaugh met with reporters at a league meeting, placing his coach in an awkward situation. Though Jackson did not explain his trade request, saying he only wanted to look forward, it seemed clear it had only been a negotiating gambit.“I really didn’t care for other teams,” he said. “I just really wanted to get something done here. I wanted to be here. Other teams are cool, but I wanted to be a Raven.”On Thursday, Jackson insisted he never doubted it would happen, that he knew what he was capable of as his own representative. He had for more than a year cordoned off the football-playing part of himself from the business part of himself.What led Odell Beckham Jr. to the Ravens“That was easy,” Jackson said. “When it was time for me to be Lamar Jackson the agent, I was Lamar Jackson the agent.”Jackson has been making what is radical seem routine for years. Even after he won the Heisman Trophy as a quarterback at Louisville, speculation that he could switch positions in the NFL persisted. Jackson’s singularity transferred to the NFL. The Ravens built a unique offense around his skill set. He unanimously won the 2019 MVP in his first year as a starter. In the regular season, the Ravens have won 73.8 percent of games Jackson started. Harbaugh sometimes tells Jackson that nobody ever has — or ever will — play quite like him.“Lamar’s unique in the way he sees the field,” Harbaugh said. “He sees it in a snapshot. He doesn’t necessarily see it in a connect-the-dots progression. He takes a big picture of the field. You ask him after a play, ‘What’d you see out there?’ He’ll give you the names of the players, where he saw them and what spots and why he did what he did. Then you back and look at the tape and you’re like, ‘That’s exactly what Lamar said.’”Harbaugh and DeCosta remained steadfast that all their plans involved Jackson playing quarterback for the Ravens. Harbaugh often spoke of his love for Jackson. Their private confidence may not have matched their public resolve, but they still always believed the saga would end with a day like Thursday.“There were some dark days,” DeCosta said. “I’m not going to lie and say every day was great. It’s been a long stretch. But we know Lamar. We know the kind of person Lamar is. He’s a phenomenal football player. But you don’t make a phenomenal football player the highest-paid player in the league. You make a phenomenal football player who’s also a phenomenal person the highest-paid player in the league.”Blackistone: Every NFL player should support Lamar Jackson's fightJackson’s career has not been quite that straightforward. Mostly charming and soft-spoken in interviews, Jackson has at times been erratic on social media. Since the Ravens drafted him, he has vowed he would deliver a Super Bowl. For all his brilliance, he has not come close. Jackson owns one career playoff victory. He has ended the past two seasons nursing injuries as Baltimore’s championship hopes crumbled.“In 2018, Lamar stood up there, and he said what we were going to do,” DeCosta said. “We’re not there yet, but we’re going to get there.”There were rocky moments, but Jackson and the Ravens still believe in one another. There has never been a quarterback negotiation quite like theirs. But there has never been an NFL player quite like Lamar Jackson.",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs will pay $215 million to settle gender bias lawsuit",
      "text": "Investment bank Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $215 million to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit that’s been ongoing for more than a decade, the company and plaintiffs announced late Monday.Former employees alleged in a complaint first filed in 2010 that Goldman “distributed the benefits of its enormous success unequally — systematically favoring male professionals at the expense of their female counterparts.”The class-action lawsuit, which covers roughly 2,800 current and former Goldman employees, was set to go to trial in New York on June 7.“My goal in this case has always been to support strong women on Wall Street,” Allison Gamba, a former Goldman stock trader and one of the named plaintiffs of the lawsuit, said in a statement. “I am proud that the result we achieved here will advance gender equity.”Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman’s global head of human capital management, said in a statement that the company was “proud of its long record of promoting and advancing women.”Goldman reported $47.4 billion in revenue in 2022.After years of progress to shrink the gender pay gap across the U.S. economy, that movement appears to have stalled, data shows. Women in the United States earn 82 cents for every dollar made by a male counterpart, a Pew Research Center study found in March.Much of that disparity, research found, is related to gender discrimination in the workplace that keeps women from gaining promotions or relegates them to lower-tier jobs, such as administrative work.Pew’s research has showed the gender pay gap to be much smaller for younger women, though it widens when family responsibilities come into play.Mothers age 25 to 34 earned 85 percent as much as fathers in the same age range in 2022, Pew found. Women in the same age group without children earned 97 cents on the dollar made by a man in 2022.The Goldman plaintiffs argued that the company’s performance review system allowed for bias that devalued women’s work, and that managers had undue sway to base reviews on subjective judgments and used that authority to elevate men and punish women.Under the terms of the settlement, which must still be approved by a judge, Goldman must hire an independent expert for three years to analyze its performance review and promotion processes, and conduct a gender pay-equity study.In 2019, the company said it would expand its diversity hiring goals, aiming to have women make up at least half of its new analyst hires from college campuses.",

      "title": "These are some of the notable companies laying off workers ",
      "text": "The U.S. job market has been remarkably strong, even in the face of other economic head winds. More than a year into the Federal Reserve’s fight to cool the economy, the United States added 236,000 jobs in March, federal data shows, and the jobless rate dropped to 3.5 percent, hovering near 50-year record lows.Yet there’s been a proliferation of large-scale layoffs in recent months. Some of the deepest cuts have occurred in the tech and media sectors: Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, HP, and the parent companies of Google and Facebook have all signaled plans to slash several thousand workers. After initially cutting thousands of workers, Amazon and Facebook just a few months later announced plans to lay off thousands more.Deeply, truly, very sorry: How tech CEOs talk when they lay off workersCompanies in other industries also are cutting back, including Goldman Sachs, Ford, 3M, Hasbro, Boeing, Disney and Tyson.Though prices have eased, inflation remains high and is an ongoing headache for the Federal Reserve, which has been raising interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to combat it, though recently it has had to confront turmoil in the banking sector that some observers attribute at least partly to the Fed’s actions. Meanwhile, many experts say at least a mild recession is likely.Technology firms and Wall Street banks, which belong to sectors more sensitive rising borrowing costs, have generated some of the most notable layoff announcements.Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at the employment website Glassdoor, said three kinds of companies are cutting staff right now: those for whom debt is becoming more expensive amid the Fed’s tightening; those uncertain about the economic outlook; and those using the economic climate as an excuse to cut employees they would have let go anyway.“The biggest question right now is this reevaluation of risk,” Terrazas said, noting that businesses coming out of the pandemic must contend with geopolitics, employee retention, investment and the supply chain.“Today’s business leaders have been scarred by this endless parade of risk events over the past couple of years and just desperately want a year when things go according to plan — and so they’re planning conservatively,” he said. “That’s the dynamic that we’re seeing in the economy.”Here’s a rundown of some of the more significant layoffs:Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is cutting about 12,000 jobs, CEO Sundar Pichai said in January. He said that the job cuts — estimated to be 6 percent of the workforce — will occur across the company and that the decision came after a “rigorous review.” Alphabet nodded to the tremendous growth the company experienced over the past two years, but demand has waned with the return to in-person life and with interest rate increases, which have made borrowing more expensive. Pichai said that the company had hired to meet the prior surge but that the economic reality the company faces now is far different.The Seattle-based e-commerce giant announced in November plans to slash roughly 10,000 corporate jobs — many from its human resources, devices and retail divisions — and raised that total to 18,000 in January. In March, Amazon said it planed to lay off an additional 9,000 workers, citing an “uncertain economy.” The reduction appears to be the largest in a decade of near-constant expansion, with more than 1.5 million employees at the end of September. Amazon, like other tech companies, went on a hiring binge during the pandemic, and analysts say the layoffs mark the end of an era marked by industry bloat. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)In November, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram announced plans to cut 11,000 jobs, or 13 percent of its workforce, in an effort to rein in expenses and focus on transforming its advertising business. The cuts underscored a tumultuous new period in Silicon Valley, whose tech giants have been long regarded as recession-proof. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, has said declines in online shopping and advertising competition led to a decline in revenue. His company has also bet big on a push to create a virtual world often called the metaverse. In March, Zuckerberg announced that an additional 10,000 workers would be cut.Microsoft plans to lay off 10,000 employees, the company said in January as part of a restructuring plan to focus on areas of growth and brace the company for an economic downturn.The tech giant is the latest corporation to cut workers amid economic uncertainty, coming off the spectacular highs of the early pandemic period, when Wall Street cheered on the staggering gains of internet, software and communications companies.The layoffs at Microsoft amount to less than 5 percent of its workforce.The cloud-computing giant — whose products include the popular workplace chat system Slack, as well as tools for sales, marketing and customer service — announced cost-cutting plans that include shedding 10 percent of its workforce. Salesforce has more than 79,000 employees, meaning the layoffs could affect nearly 8,000 people. Co-chief executive Marc Benioff said the company hired too many people when its sales surged during the pandemic. Salesforce’s latest quarterly report showed a slowdown in its revenue growth rate.Soon after Elon Musk acquired the San Francisco-based social media company in October 2022, he fired much of the company’s top brass and laid off roughly half of its 7,500 workers. Hundreds more workers departed in November after refusing to sign a pledge to work longer hours, The Washington Post reported. It laid off another 200 people on Feb. 25, according to the New York Times.The Tesla billionaire has been under extreme financial pressure since the deal wrapped up in October; analysts have pegged Twitter’s value near $25 billion, well below the $44 billion footed by Musk and his investors. He is expected to owe $1 billion in annual interest payments alone, after taking out a large loan to help pay for it. The site also has seen a significant drop in ad revenue.Elon Musk showed us how not to fire peopleThe entertainment behemoth announced in February that it planned to cut around 7,000 jobs in a sweeping effort to save $5.5 billion. The reductions came only months after Bob Iger, who led Disney through its golden age, returned to the company, promising big changes. In announcing the cuts, Iger said Disney is “committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment.”Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is reducing its workforce by 5 percent, or about 1,250 jobs, Reuters reported in February. The media giant that publishes the Wall Street Journal posted a 10.6 percent decline in advertising revenue, part of an industry-wide slump accompanying higher interest rates. It also incurred $6 million in one-time costs because of a scrapped merger with Fox Corp.The computer giant said in November that it would trim 4,000 to 6,000 workers by the end of 2025 in an effort to reduce costs. The announcement came after HP reported an 11.2 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue compared with the same period in 2021; full-year sales dipped 0.8 percent. The staff reductions were included in the company’s “future ready transformation” plan.The PC maker is shedding about 5 percent of its workforce, or around 6,650 positions. Plunging demand for personal computers has forced the company to enact a broader cost-cutting program that also includes a hiring freeze and a pullback on travel. “What we know is market conditions continue to erode with an uncertain future,” Dell Vice Chairman Jeff Clarke told employees, according to a Feb. 6 SEC filing. “The steps we’ve taken to stay ahead of downturn impacts — which enabled several strong quarters in a row — are no longer enough. We now have to make additional decisions to prepare for the road ahead.”The technology company plans to cut around 3,900 positions, or about 1.5 percent of its global workforce. IBM said the cuts were related to earlier divestitures of its Kyndryl and Watson Health businesses, although those moves took place long before the job cuts were announced in late January.The European software giant announced plans to eliminate 2,800 employees, or 2.5 percent of its workforce, citing a “targeted restructuring” and plans to “strengthen its core business and improve overall process efficiency,” according to a January earnings report.The San Francisco-based communications technology firm announced on Feb. 13  that it would be laying off 17 percent of its workforce. That’s 1,500 jobs based on Twilio’s Sept. 30 head count of roughly 9,000 people, according to an SEC filing. Executives said the cuts were part of a broader restructuring plan designed to shift the company toward greater profitability.“For the last 15 years, we ran Twilio for growth, building a tremendous customer base, product set, and revenue base. But environments change — and so must we. Now we have to prioritize profit far more than before,” wrote Jeff Lawson, Twilio’s co-founder and chief executive, in a Feb. 13 blog post announcing the layoffs.The Arlington, Va.-based aerospace giant plans to shed roughly 2,000 non-unionized jobs, primarily in the company’s human resources and finance divisions, a Boeing spokesman confirmed on Feb. 7. The spokesman emphasized that the company plans to hire about 10,000 people throughout 2023, following 15,000 hires the year before.“We expect lower staffing within some corporate support functions so that we can focus our resources in engineering and manufacturing and directly supporting our products, services and technology development efforts,” the spokesman said.Redirecting its focus on electric vehicles and their batteries, Ford in August let go about 3,000 white-collar contract employees, according to the Wall Street Journal. It represented a 1 percent reduction in Ford’s 183,000-person workforce and mainly affected workers in the United States, Canada and India, according to the Journal. On Feb. 14, the automaker announced plans to cut 3,800 jobs in Europe, while expanding battery production operations in Michigan as part of a broader transition toward electric vehicles.The investment bank started shedding as many as 3,200 jobs in early January following a slump in dealmaking in 2022. As with other Wall Street banks, Goldman’s employees expected a drop in annual bonuses, according to the New York Times, and getting no bonus at all can be taken as a sign to leave.The investment bank’s cuts will go well beyond a ritual year-end culling of underperformers, according to multiple news outlets. Goldman’s head count would still be higher than it was going into the pandemic, the Wall Street Journal reported, noting it was roughly 49,000 compared with 38,000 in 2019.3M said it would cut 2,500 manufacturing jobs after the company reported rapid declines in its consumer-facing markets, including slowing demand for disposable respirators and covid-related disruptions in China. The company said the cuts are part of a strategy to address slower than expected growth, as it adjusts its manufacturing output. The layoffs will affect about 3 percent of 3M’s workforce.“We expect macroeconomic challenges to persist in 2023,” chief executive Mike Roman said.In December, the investment bank trimmed about 1,600 workers, or 2 percent of its workforce, CNBC reported. The cuts appeared to be part of a tradition among Morgan Stanley and its peers to cut a percentage of low performers at year’s end — a practice that had been suspended during the pandemic. But the following May, the bank started discussions about a new round of layoffs totaling some 3,000 workers, according to multiple news outlets including Bloomberg News.The bank had seen its head count grow roughly 34 percent since early 2020, partly as a result of two acquisitions. By the end of 2022, inflation had cut into the bank’s dealmaking, according to Reuters, putting pressure on investment banks that earned record profits a year earlier from consulting on mergers, acquisitions and IPOs.Swollen by pandemic hiring, the food delivery company in November shed 1,250 corporate jobs, about 6 percent of its workforce. Chief executive Tony Xu said in a note to employees that company leaders were “not as rigorous as we should have been in managing our team growth,” as the company’s revenue growth was eclipsed by operating expenses.The world’s second-largest fashion retailer, based in Sweden, said in November that it would cut 1,500 positions, about 1 percent of its workforce. The move was part of a $177 million effort to cut costs amid surging inflation in Europe tied to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. Compounding the retailer’s woes were disappointing third-quarter results as it struggled to keep up with Inditex, the owner of Zara.The cryptocurrency exchange said in a November blog post that it would slash 30 percent of its payroll, or 1,100 workers, to “adapt to current market conditions.” The industry experienced a dramatic downturn in 2022, erasing billions of dollars of investments.Kraken said that it had tripled its global workforce in recent years and that the reduction would bring its head count back to 2021 levels. “Unfortunately, negative influences on the financial markets have continued and we have exhausted preferable options for bringing costs in line with demand,” the company wrote.Online payment company Stripe will cut 14 percent of its workforce. In a memo to staff in November, the company said the 1,100 job cuts will return Stripe’s head count to almost what it was in February 2022.Shopify announced last summer that 10 percent of its staff would be laid off. The company reported a head count at the end of 2021 of more than 10,000 people, meaning the layoffs are estimated to impact about 1,000 workers.Video-streaming company Vimeo said in early January that it would lay off about 11 percent of its staff, or about 140 people, “due to the uncertain economic environment.”In a staff memo on April 20, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said the company will lay off 15 percent of the company and begin shuttering BuzzFeed News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning online publication that was started in 2011 as an adjunct to the primary BuzzFeed site, which specializes in listicles about celebrities and popular culture.Other media companies are also shedding staff amid a softening advertising climate and economic uncertainty. CNN, whose former parent company had merged with Discovery in early 2022, had earlier announced hundreds of job cuts. The country’s largest newspaper chain, Gannett, underwent a round of layoffs that was expected to affect roughly 200 journalists, shortly after it shed about 400 positions in August and froze hiring for hundreds more positions. Paramount Global reportedly laid off several dozen workers, and Disney has implemented a hiring freeze amid plans to restructure.Vox Media, the company behind New York Magazine, the Verge and Vox, is cutting about 7 percent of its staff, the company said on Jan. 20. Chief executive Jim Bankoff said in a note to staff that cuts will affect multiple teams throughout the company, affecting about 130 people.The Washington Post laid off 20 of its 2,500 employees in January. The move follows action taken last year to shutter The Post’s Sunday magazine and lay off 11 newsroom employees.In January, the cryptocurrency exchange announced that it was eliminating 950 jobs in an effort to reduce operating expenses. In a blog post, chief executive Brian Armstrong wrote that the cuts come as the industry “trended downward along with the broader macroeconomy” in 2022.Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek announced on Jan. 23 that the streaming company would slash 6 percent of its workforce, citing the “need to become more efficient” and over-hiring during the pandemic. “I take full accountability for the moves that got us here today,” Ek wrote in a blog post, which also discussed reorganization plans.According to its most recent annual filing, Spotify had just over 6,600 employees at the end of 2021.The toy and entertainment giant announced on Jan. 26  that it would eliminate 15 percent of its global workforce amid broader organizational changes designed to yield $250 million to $300 million in savings by the end of 2025. The layoffs will affect roughly 1,000 jobs and be rolled out over the next several weeks.Hasbro’s consumer products division “underperformed in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of a challenging holiday consumer environment,” CEO Chris Cocks said in a news release. The company owns a wide array of brands, including Wizards of the Coast, Monopoly and Playskool.The e-signature company plans to lay off about 10 percent of its workforce as part of a broader restructuring plan. An earlier round of layoffs affected about 9 percent of the company, according to CNBC, which reported on Feb. 16 that the latest cuts will bring DocuSign’s head count to around 700.The chemical company announced in late January that it planned to reduce its workforce by 2,000, or about 5.5 percent of its workforce, as it seeks to save $1 billion in 2023. The plans also include closing down certain company assets and “aligning spending levels to the macroeconomic environment.”Jim Fitterling, Dow’s chairman and chief executive, said those actions would allow the company to navigate “macro uncertainties and challenging energy markets, particularly in Europe.”Online payment company PayPal said it will lay off 2,000 employees, or about 7 percent of its global workforce. In a memo to staff published to the company’s website, chief executive Dan Schulman said PayPal made significant progress in addressing “the challenging macroeconomic environment” but added the company has “more work to do,” as it restructures and focuses on core priorities. The cuts will occur over the next several weeks, Schulman said.The videoconference company said in February that it would lay off 15 percent of its workforce, or 1,300 workers — and chief executive, Eric Yuan, said he’d take a 98 percent pay cut. Yuan said the company had not assessed whether it was growing sustainably, as its product became ubiquitous during pandemic lockdowns and business skyrocketed. Now that much of the world has returned to in-person life, some consumers have emerged in a state of “Zoom fatigue” — and the company’s shares have plummeted.The media and technology company said in February it planned to lay off 20 percent of its workforce as it embarks on a restructuring plan that would impact its advertising unit. Chief executive Jim Lanzone told Axios that the cuts were strategic and not financial. In 2021, the private-equity firm Apollo Global Management acquired Yahoo and AOL in a $5 billion deal with Verizon.Facing a $30 million shortfall, the radio broadcaster announced in February that it planned to lay off about 10 percent of its staff, or roughly 100 people. In a memo to staff, CEO John Lansing said the broadcasting company was experiencing a decline in advertising revenue, especially in podcasting. He also noted the tough environment for the media industry in general.The telecommunications giant plans to cut a total of 8,500 positions, or 8 percent of its workforce, by the end of 2023, CNN reported on Feb. 24. The company experienced lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as equipment sales slowed in the United States, according to Reuters.The consulting firm Accenture in late March said it planned to cut 2.5 percent of its workforce, roughly 19,000 jobs, after lowering its annual revenue and profit projections. The company had expected revenue growth of between 8 and 11 percent, but it revised that forecast down to between 8 and 10 percent. The company wrote in a securities filing that it expects more than half of the layoffs to occur among employees in “nonbillable corporate functions.”The job-searching company announced in March that it would lay off 2,200 people, or 15 percent of its staff. In a March 22 memo to staff, chief executive Chris Hyams cited a decline in U.S. job openings, which he predicted would fall even further in the next few years. “With future job openings at or below pre-pandemic levels, our organization is simply too big for what lies ahead,” added Hyams, who said he’d take a 25 percent cut in base pay.The streaming media device company said it planned to cut about 6 percent of the company’s workforce, or about 200 employees, according to a government filing on March 29. The layoffs are part of a restructuring plan, the company said, designed to lower Roku’s growth in operating expenses and “prioritize projects that the Company believes will have a higher return on investment.” In addition, Roku said it will exit and sublease or stop using certain office facilities that it does not currently occupy. The layoffs come after the company parted ways with 200 U.S. employees in November, citing the “current economic conditions in our industry.”Apple plans to lay off a small number employees from its retail teams, which are responsible for the construction and upkeep of the company’s global retail stores, Bloomberg reported in April, citing sources familiar with the plans. At the time, Apple had been the only tech giant to not announce major cuts to its workforce. Still, it is pulling back in some areas, including by trimming contractors such as engineers, recruiters and security guards, according to Bloomberg.Deloitte plans to cut around 1,200 jobs as part of a broader restructuring, the Financial Times reported on April 21, citing internal employee communications.The ride-share giant announced April 27 that it would lay off more than a quarter of its workforce, or 1,072 employees, according to a regulatory filing. It will also eliminate 250 vacant positions. The separations will cost Lyft up to $47 million in severance payments, the company said.The major food producer said on April 26 that it will eliminate roughly 10 percent of its corporate workforce and 15 percent of senior leadership roles. The cuts are likely to amount to hundreds of workers; the company had 6,000 U.S. corporate employees as of Oct. 1, Reuters reported, and 118,000 in other facilities nationwide, including meatpacking plants. Tyson has already shed some corporate jobs. In October, it centralized its corporate workforce at its headquarters in Arkansas, leading some workers to leave the company.The parent company of Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy and Athleta announced on April 27 that it is eliminating 1,800 leadership roles in its headquarters and stores as part of a plan for “simplifying and optimizing our operating model.” The move will save the company $300 million dollars annually, interim chief executive Bob Martin said in a statement.The cloud storage and software firm said April 27 that it would lay off 500 employees, about 16 percent of the company. Chief executive Drew Houston wrote in a staff memo that Dropbox’s growth had slowed as a result of the larger economic downturn even though the company remains profitable. He also wrote that the company will be increasing its investment in artificial intelligence and needs to reorganize its staffing to prioritize those skills.Unity, which makes a software platform widely used in mobile and virtual reality games, plans to lay off 600 people, according to a May 2 SEC filing. The layoffs cover about 8 percent of the company’s workforce.The Microsoft-owned networking platform is laying off 716 employees as part of a global reorganization that will phase out the company’s China-based local jobs app, InCareer, according to a public letter from chief executive Ryan Roslansky. “Though InCareer experienced some success in the past year thanks to our strong China-based team, it also encountered fierce competition and a challenging macroeconomic climate,” Roslansky wrote.The vaccine manufacturer plans to lay off about 25 percent of its global workforce while also consolidating facilities and infrastructure, the company announced as part of its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. That would translate to a little less than 500 jobs based on the company’s head count on Feb. 21, the most recent figure available in regulatory filings.",

      "title": "Capitals give defenseman Alex Alexeyev a two-year extension",
      "text": "The Washington Capitals ­re-signed defenseman Alex Alexeyev to a two-year contract extension Tuesday, keeping the 23-year-old Russian in the fold as the team looks to solidify its blue line for next season and beyond.Alexeyev’s one-way contract, which is worth $775,000 next season and $875,000 in 2024-25, had been considered a priority for the front office and was one of the first moves in what is expected to be a transformative offseason for the team after it missed the postseason for the first time in nine seasons.While the Capitals continue their search for a new coach who will be able to connect with their veteran core, they are also looking for a leader who can help develop younger players such as Alexeyev, who was set to become a restricted free agent this summer. He is projected to be one of Washington’s primary six defensemen next season. At 6-foot-4 and 213 pounds, Alexeyev is a big, physical presence who showed flashes of promise on the blue line for Washington late in the season. After undergoing shoulder surgery last summer, Alexeyev worked his way into the lineup late in March and logged heavy minutes as the Capitals endured attrition through injuries and dealt multiple defensemen at the trade deadline. Alexeyev averaged just over 16 minutes of ice time and finished with five assists in 32 games. He also tied for fifth on the Capitals in blocked shots per 60 minutes (5.46).Alexeyev is the second young Russian player in the organization to earn a new contract in as many days. On Monday, the Capitals signed 19-year-old forward Ivan Miroshnichenko, the team’s 2022 first-round pick, to a three-year entry-level contract worth $855,000 in the NHL. That deal came after Miroshnichenko moved on from the Kontinental Hockey League, where he played last season.Washington also added a potential future depth piece last month in defenseman Hardy Haman Aktell, a 2016 Nashville Predators draft pick who signed a one-year, two-way, entry-level contract with the Capitals after shining in the Swedish Hockey League last season.Alongside right-handed veterans John Carlson, Nick Jensen and Trevor van Riemsdyk, Washington has three left-handed defensemen who are just 23 years old and figure to be in the top six next season: Alexeyev, Rasmus Sandin and Martin Fehervary, who is a restricted free agent this summer and could be next to receive an extension as Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan looks to strengthen the defensive corps.“I think we could still improve it a little bit. We’ll look at opportunities to do that,” MacLellan said last month. “I like the right side, what they’ve contributed. They all have roles they fill within our team, and they all do it well. The left side, we’ve got three 23-year-old guys that are all looking to improve and get better and get to the next level.”",

      "text": "You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.In South and Southeast Asia, it’s generally hot around this time of year. But not this hot. Temperature records have tumbled in multiple countries in recent days. Over the weekend, cities in Cambodia and Laos experienced the hottest days ever recorded in either country, with temperatures reaching 44.2 degrees Celsius, or around 112 Fahrenheit, in Vietnam’s northern Tuong Duong district, and 43.5 degrees Celsius, or around 110 Fahrenheit, in the popular Laotian tourist destination of Luang Prabang.A severe heat wave unfurled across a wide swath of Asia. From India to the Philippines, officials in various municipalities shuttered schools and urged locals to stay home and ward against signs of heat-induced fatigue. Scorching temperatures melted roads in Bangladesh, and numerous voters fainted as they lined up at polling stations for advance voting in Thailand’s election. High temperatures are expected to last through the end of the month, as climate scientists and researchers point to the mounting evidence of what human-induced climate change is doing to our planet.By some measures, Asia just experienced its hottest April on record. Globally, the past eight years have been the eight warmest on record. Experts warn that the warming temperatures will make deadly heat waves both more frequent and longer-lasting events. The current wave through Southeast Asia may be linked to another possible impact of climate change, with shifts in the hydrologic cycle leading to suppressed rainfall in parts of the region over the winter. “Because dry soil heats up faster than moist soil, a hot anomaly naturally forms as spring arrives,” explained Koh Tieh Yong, a climate scientist at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, to Bloomberg News.“Approximately 18.3 percent of Laotians live in poverty, and are far more likely to be harmed by elevated temperatures,” noted my colleague Matthew Cappucci. “It’s likely that significant excess mortality — or premature deaths caused by the intersection of heat stress and preexisting vulnerabilities — is occurring across Southeast Asia.”He cited the tweets of Maximiliano Herrera, a climate historian who tracks temperature records and who wrote that the recent wave was “one of the most brutal heat event[s] the world has ever witnessed.”What it’s like to toil in India’s dangerous, unrelenting heatSE Asia Heat Wave:Cambodia had its hottest May day on records on the 6th with 41.6C at Kratie and at Ponhea Kraek.In Cambodian history,only April 2016 saw higher temperatures.Record heat again in #Bangkok with 31.1C at Don Muang (30.9C Metropolis) highest ever Tmin in Bangkok https://t.co/m0n6WgYriQFor much of the world, and especially in many countries in Asia, these hot months are a grim augur of things to come. Not only are daytime temperatures breaking records, but so too the measurements after sunset, adding to the misery of countless people seeking respite from the sweltering conditions. India, the world’s most populous country, is also one of the world’s countries most vulnerable to climate change. It experienced a record-breaking set of heat waves last year, while this year it saw its hottest February in 122 years. Temperatures neared record levels in recent weeks, with dozens dying due to the conditions.While the country is accustomed to extreme heat, experts fear the combined effects of spiking temperatures and the potential return of the weather pattern known as El Niño may wreak significant damage. “The health department as well as the disaster-management authority, I think, have not thought through what the impacts might be to people if the heat worsens later this year,” Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Gujarat-based Indian Institute of Public Health, to the South China Morning Post. “If El Nino disrupts India’s monsoon season, there will be a deficit of rain and, of course, this will hugely impact agriculture and farming, and, as a result, the economy.”Recent research also suggests that India’s combination of high heat and humidity is pushing its population to struggle in circumstances beyond the literally perilous “wet bulb” threshold — that is, the estimation that above 35 degrees Celsius, the human body can no longer adequately cool itself through perspiration. In these conditions, brain damage and heart and kidney failure are more common.“The Indo-Gangetic Plain is one of the few places where such wet-bulb temperatures have been recorded, including on several occasions in the scorched Pakistani town of Jacobabad,” detailed the Economist. “A report by the World Bank in November warned that India could become one of the first places where wet-bulb temperatures routinely exceed the 35 degree Celsius survivability threshold.”A future of more extreme heat has other measurable impacts. “Estimates show a 15 percent decrease in outdoor working capacity … during daylight hours due to extreme heat by 2050,” a study published in the journal PLOS Climate reported, laying out projections specifically for India. “The increased heat is expected to cost India 2.8 percent and 8.7 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and depressed living standards by 2050 and 2100, respectively.”What extreme heat does to the human bodyAway from Asia, the situation isn’t much better. The past month saw temperature records fall on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar, with Spain coping with perhaps its worst drought in a century. An epochal drought in the Horn of Africa has directly impacted some 50 million people in the region and is the bleak subtext lurking behind a morass of armed conflicts.And the phenomena provoked by climate change may only be accelerating. A study published Monday found that a major glacier in Greenland is melting much faster than anticipated, prompting speculation that current projections for sea level rise may be too conservative. “Overall the new study again underscores that we don’t really know how quickly one of the largest consequences of climate change — sea level rise from the melting ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica — will occur,” wrote my colleague Chris Mooney. “We’re still finding out new details — and new reasons to think that it could be faster than expected.”",

      "title": "Ethen Frank, a talent out of Nebraska, sees opportunity with the Caps",
      "text": "HERSHEY, Pa. — Ethen Frank was already on his way to a memorable rookie season with the Hershey Bears when he received a questionnaire from the American Hockey League. It asked Frank to rank the seven events he might want to participate in at the all-star skills challenge. He scanned it. The shooting challenges made him nervous and took too long, he thought to himself, so he listed the fastest skater event as his preference and sent the survey back.When it came time to compete in the event in Quebec in February, Frank skated his lap as hard as he could. When he finished, he looked back at the clock on the ice: 12.915 seconds. No AHL or NHL player had ever bettered 13 seconds in the event, he was later told, and Frank was eventually summoned to the Hall of Fame in Toronto. He delivered the black Bauer skates he used — with “Franky” written just above the blades — to be put on display.A few weeks after the milestone, Frank signed a two-way contract with the Washington Capitals for next season.Frank arrived in Hershey at an opportune time: His 30-goal rookie season helped the Bears earn a Calder Cup playoff berth, and he positioned himself as an intriguing prospect for the Capitals, who have one of the NHL’s oldest rosters and are trying to retool their lineup with more speed and youth.“The opportunities are probably going to arise sooner or later,” Frank said in an interview last month. “So as long as you keep your head down and work hard, I’m sure the chips will fall where they may.”It has been a surreal year for Frank, who grew up in Papillion, Neb., a suburb of Omaha that isn’t a hockey hotbed. Frank was obsessed with the game from an early age — he had Fathead posters of Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby on his bedroom walls — but he largely learned to skate by playing roller hockey on asphalt.“I give pretty much all of my credit to that and my dad for teaching me how to skate. I didn’t really do a whole lot being from Omaha. There’s not a ton of skating coaches or anything like that out there,” Frank said. “My dad always said, ‘Speed kills.’ ”Frank honed that speed on a youth hockey team that traveled all over the Midwest to compete in tournaments. His coaches fought to get him and his teammates in front of scouts, which eventually landed Frank at Western Michigan University, where he played for five years after two seasons were shortened because of the coronavirus pandemic.At 25, he’s older than most AHL rookies. There were stretches during his first year when the league’s grueling schedule — often featuring long bus trips and three games in three days — exhausted him. But he turned in one of the best rookie seasons in Hershey in recent years: Frank led the team in goals, power-play goals and shots. He closed the regular season with his first hat trick to push his total to 30 goals, the most by a Bears rookie since Craig Fisher scored a rookie franchise record 43 in 1990-91.“He’s been taking positive strides throughout the whole season. The next step is to see how he performs in the playoffs. That’s the next area of growth,” Hershey Coach Todd Nelson said. “I wouldn’t say this is a surprise. We knew he had skill. But he’s taken it to the next level. I think there is a lot of positives in the future for him.”The Capitals have a handful of young forwards they brought into the mix late in the season after the team was eliminated from playoff contention, including Beck Malenstyn, Joe Snively and Henrik Borgstrom. There are others who figure to be in the mix once training camp starts, including Connor McMichael, who was shuffled between his natural position of center and the wing during his stints with Washington over the past two seasons.At 5-foot-10 and 178 pounds, Frank is an undersized forward who offers Washington dynamic speed and scoring ability. He’s expected to bring that to training camp before next season, where he’ll try to catch the eye of a new Capitals coach.It isn’t new territory for Frank. He was always working to get noticed as a little-known prospect from Nebraska. In Hershey, he had to prove he could handle the rigors of professional hockey, which provided the stage for him to show off his speed during the all-star skills challenge, take a trip to the Hall of Fame and eventually earn an NHL contract.“Pretty humbling signing that contract,” he said. “It’s kind of been a long ride. That’s always been the dream goal.”",

      "title": "Advice | Crypto is not the key to Black generational wealth",
      "text": "The idea that cryptocurrency will make you rich is appealing.But for many Black Americans, it’s also being pitched as the answer to decades of financial disenfranchisement.I’ve listened on Zoom calls and at seminars as promoters hawked the crypto revolution to Black folks, downplaying the risks of the deeply volatile asset. The industry has even co-opted luminaries like LeBron James, whose foundation partners with Crypto.com, to teach kids about cryptocurrency and the technology behind digital assets.“Blockchain technology is revolutionizing our economy, sports and entertainment, the art world, and how we engage with one another,” the NBA superstar said in a statement announcing the partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation. “I want to ensure that communities like the one I come from are not left behind.”But cryptocurrency is so speculative that investors, especially financially vulnerable ones, are simply better off buying low-cost, no-frills stock index funds.“Crypto investing is extremely high risk,” Algernon Austin, director for Race and Economic Justice at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), said during an interview about cryptocurrency investing and building Black wealth. “As an investment, it’s closer to gambling.”Americans view crypto investing as unreliable. They’re right.Austin co-authored a report released earlier this year comparing crypto with index funds. When looking at a random sampling of 100 cryptocurrencies — all in the top 1,000 by market capitalization — Austin and his team found that the median cryptocurrency declined 46.6 percent from August 2017 to August 2022. But a total stock market index fund climbed 56.4 percent during that period, while an S&P 500 index fund surged 60.8 percent.Let’s put that in dollar terms.If someone had purchased $1,000 worth of a cryptocurrency from the top 1,000 currencies in 2017, it would have lost nearly half its value over the five-year span, the report showed. “In contrast, if someone had purchased $1,000 worth of a total stock market or S&P 500 index fund, it would have increased to about $1,600,” the report said. “While it is possible to create significant wealth with cryptocurrencies very quickly, it appears to be more likely that someone will lose money investing in cryptocurrencies than will profit from it.”So, no, cryptocurrencies are not helping Black people build generational wealth.If you want more personal finance advice that's timeless, order your copy of Michelle Singletary's Money Milestones.Cryptocurrencies have outperformed index funds over shorter stretches of time, but the reward isn’t worth the risk long term, Austin said. Early investors in bitcoin have seen large returns, but today’s investors are buying high with stratospheric volatility.Although an index fund doesn’t guarantee profit — no investment does — it’s less risky and more appropriate for most investors.The data is clear, Austin said, citing research by economists at the Bank for International Settlements showing that three-quarters of investors in bitcoin, the largest crypto by market capitalization, have lost money.“The volatile price of cryptocurrencies prevents them from becoming widely used as a means of payment,” the researchers said in the 2022 working paper. Here’s another major problem for today’s investors: Their timing is off.In a recent Pew Research Center survey, 24 percent of Asian adults and 21 percent of Black or Hispanic adults say they have invested in or used a cryptocurrency, compared with just 14 percent of White adults. Overall, data shows 17 percent of U.S. adults fall into one of these categories.But Pew found that Blacks are more likely than Whites to say they used cryptocurrency for the first time within the past year.Six signs crypto investment is a classic Ponzi schemeThat’s disturbing, given the turmoil in the industry. The price of a bitcoin has nosedived from a high of $68,000 in November 2021 to about $27,000 this week.Investors may be thinking: “Great, I’ll jump in now, buy low, and ride the wave up to wealth.”Except there’s more to it than price.There was the collapse of the celebrity-endorsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX co-founder and chief executive, has been indicted on eight counts, including wire fraud and money laundering.Crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy protection. Two major cryptocurrencies — TerraUSD and Luna — crashed, and Do Kwon, the founder of the digitals, has been charged with fraud.Signature Bank’s collapse spells trouble for cryptocurrency industryPew found that 45 percent of Americans reported their investment performed worse than expected, compared with 15 percent who said it outperformed.Or, as Austin noted during our interview, just look at what JPMorgan Chase & Co. found when analyzing client data. Out of nearly 5 million checking account customers, more than 600,000 made transfers to crypto accounts.It also found that lower-income investors were more likely to purchase digital currency at elevated prices than high-income individuals.“Using bitcoin prices around the time of transfers to crypto accounts as a proxy for investment price, we find that lower-income households bought crypto at substantially higher prices,” the report said.And, of course, Blacks are overrepresented among the nation’s low-income population, Austin pointed out.SEC charges two crypto platforms with failing to disclose risksWealthier and more savvy investors in crypto, who are disproportionally White, have been able to get in and out at the right time. “The research suggests they’re profiting off lower-income investors,” he said.Let’s recap.Promote it, and they will come. It’s been the mantra for crypto champions, many of whom are creating wealth for themselves by selling to less sophisticated investors who are ill-equipped to recover from major losses.“The industry spent all this money on advertisements and all these celebrities to attract many people,” Austin said. “Index funds don’t do that. You don’t have basketball players and celebrities like Matt Damon doing commercials about index funds.”Damon and James appeared in commercials for crypto.com with the tagline “Fortune Favors the Brave.”Do you know what’s brave?Ignoring the feverish cryptocurrency flimflam — including from seemingly well-meaning Black influencers — in favor of historically proven low-cost index funds.

      "title": "Nats’ Jake Irvin fits right in as he gets his first major league win",
      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — With the final out of the fifth inning recorded, Washington Nationals right-hander Jake Irvin smiled after Luis García hauled in a popup and seemed to share a joke with the home plate umpire as he walked back to the dugout.The previous at-bat, the San Francisco Giants’ Blake Sabol attempted to bunt with two strikes. He pulled his bat back for what he thought was a sinker falling out of the strike zone. But when the pitch was indeed ruled a strike, Irvin hopped into the infield grass and pointed at catcher Keibert Ruiz.Irvin had no shortage of confidence Monday night at Oracle Park. Leading the Nationals to a 5-1 victory thanks to his 6⅓ scoreless innings, Irvin had every reason to carry himself that way after earning his first major league win.“Baseball’s always supposed to be fun, right?” Irvin said. “Just went out there, made pitches. Same old thing. Having a blast, enjoying San Francisco.”Irvin made his major league debut Wednesday at Nationals Park, pitching 4⅓ innings and allowing just one run against the Chicago Cubs. He didn’t look overwhelmed by the moment. In fact, he seemed to embrace it. He built on that performance by being more efficient Monday, throwing 92 pitches while allowing just four hits and striking out five.It helped that Irvin had a 5-0 lead before he took the mound. Every National batted in the first inning as they collected seven hits (six singles and an Alex Call double) and five runs off San Francisco’s Anthony DeSclafani, who entered the game leading the National League in WHIP (0.816). The Nationals (15-20) saw just 21 pitches in the inning. Four straight singles opened the game, including a Joey Meneses RBI knock that gave Washington a 1-0 lead. Two batters later, Dominic Smith had an RBI single of his own. Call followed with an RBI double before CJ Abrams smacked the final single of the inning, this one pushing home two runs to make it 5-0.The Nationals continued to be aggressive for the rest of DeSclafani’s outing but to no avail from there; he finished seven innings on 92 pitches despite allowing 10 hits. But he was no match for Irvin.Irvin got a pair of strikeouts on his curveball in the first two innings, ending the second by getting Mitch Haniger looking. He hopped off the mound again as he walked toward the dugout.Any trouble Irvin seemed to run into against the Giants (15-19) was negated by his ability to throw pitches that turned into double play balls. In the first, Joc Pederson hit into an inning-ending 4-6-3 double play. Michael Conforto grounded into a 6-3 double play in the second. The first two runners reached in the fourth before J.D. Davis hit into another 6-3 double play.“He’s got really good poise,” Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said. “He goes out there and competes. The best thing is he’s around the zone, he’s throwing strikes. Defense played really well behind him and turned some double plays, but, hey, he’s out there and he’s got a lot of poise. Doesn’t let nothing rattle him. Irvin recorded the first out of the seventh inning, making the outing the longest of his professional career. Irvin, a fourth-round draft pick out of Oklahoma in 2018, didn’t pitch in 2021 after Tommy John surgery, and the organization managed his innings as he returned.He was under control for six innings, but his night ended unceremoniously after a single and a walk — his third of the game — in the seventh. Carl Edwards Jr. finished the inning, then threw a scoreless eighth before Andrés Machado handled the ninth, allowing a solo homer by Pederson that wasn’t nearly enough.Before Monday’s game, Martinez said he is hopeful Chad Kuhl can throw a simulated game Tuesday to see how his foot feels. Kuhl was placed on the injured list May 1 with right foot metalarsalgia, which led to Irvin’s call-up to fill his spot in the rotation.Svrluga: The Kuhls made it to MLB together. They’ll fight cancer the same way.After Irvin’s first start, Martinez wouldn’t immediately commit to Irvin starting in case Kuhl was ready to return. Now, though it’s only been two starts, Irvin is making the case that he should stay in the rotation even if Kuhl is ready to return.“I’m just trying to take it one day at a time,” Irvin said. “Be where my feet are, enjoy the moment and keep winning ballgames.”Victor Robles came in and got treatment for his back Monday afternoon in San Francisco after being placed on the 10-day IL with back spasms. Robles injured himself in Phoenix on Saturday sliding into second base and exited in the fourth inning.Corey Dickerson has been sidelined since the first series of the year with a left calf strain, and Martinez seems optimistic that Dickerson could head to a minor league assignment soon. Dickerson was fielding groundballs in the outfield before Monday’s game.",

      "title": "Analysis | Kevin Durant and Devin Booker are getting a peek at Suns’ next era",
      "text": "This is an excerpt from Ben Golliver’s NBA Post Up weekly newsletter. Sign up to get the latest news and commentary and the best high jinks from #NBATwitter and R/NBA delivered to your inbox every Monday.When Chris Paul was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2020, the franchise had missed the playoffs for 10 straight seasons and was stuck in a losing cycle marked by coaching changes and poor draft picks.The future Hall of Fame point guard’s arrival was transformational: The Suns made the NBA Finals in 2021, won a franchise-record 64 games in 2021-22 and moved on from disgraced owner Robert Sarver last fall. After a decade of Phoenix being ignored by superstars, a disgruntled Kevin Durant successfully sought a trade from the Brooklyn Nets to the Suns in February. That type of blockbuster never happens without the years of groundwork laid by Paul’s experienced hands.During the past two postseasons, Paul’s quality of play has strongly correlated with Phoenix’s results. The 12-time all-star came up huge in closeout wins over the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers in the 2021 playoffs, and he shot a perfect 14 for 14 to eliminate the New Orleans Pelicans from last year’s first round. But when Paul ran out of gas in the 2021 Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks and in the second round against the Dallas Mavericks last year, the Suns quickly faltered. Not even the impressive rise of all-star guard Devin Booker could save them.A different story unfolded this weekend. With Phoenix facing a 2-0 series deficit in the second round against Denver, Paul missed Games 3 and 4 with a groin injury. Instead of looking lost or frazzled without their floor general, the Suns kicked into high gear with a 121-114 Game 3 win Friday and a 129-124 Game 4 victory Sunday. Along the way, they got a glimpse at what their future might look like if they work to optimize their roster and payroll around Durant and Booker, their new superstar duo.“We’re still learning each other,” Durant said after finishing with 36 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in Game 4. “[Booker] is always comfortable out there on any spot on the floor, and I feel like I’m the same way. The more reps we get, the better we’re going to get. But right now, I think we’re in a solid groove.”Paul’s injury absence led Suns Coach Monty Williams to seek more offensive firepower by calling on guards Landry Shamet, T.J. Warren and Terrence Ross, even if that meant risking some defensive mistakes. Rather than maintaining a stingy rotation filled with defensive specialists around his stars, Williams allowed Durant and Booker to lead a more freewheeling approach and take advantage of the newfound space created by their complementary shooters.The results were shocking: Durant, 34, and Booker, 26, combined for 86 points and 17 assists in Game 3, then followed that up with 72 points and 18 assists in Game 4. The two were so comfortable and so engaged that the Suns survived a 53-point, 11-assist onslaught from Nuggets center Nikola Jokic on Sunday. That shared output rivaled Durant’s most productive days alongside Kyrie Irving in Brooklyn, and Booker’s scoring efficiency, passing instincts and focused demeanor make him an even more attractive and reliable long-term partner.“We’re using each other’s gravity and learning to play off each other,” Booker said. “That’s the easiest way to do it. Let one of us be the point of attack and play from there. I wouldn’t say there’s a ceiling [on our future]. I don’t try to put any restrictions on anything I do. We’ve been going with different lineups throughout this series. It’s a lot of new for us.”Phoenix’s shot distribution took on a more modern look, and its lack of depth didn’t seem quite as fatal. After making just six three-pointers in a Game 2 loss, the Suns connected on 13 three-pointers in Game 4, nearly double the Nuggets’ total.Nikola Jokic, Suns owner Mat Ishbia get into a courtside altercationShamet scored 19 points and hit five three-pointers, becoming the first Suns reserve to reach double digits in this series while outscoring the Nuggets’ second unit by himself. The 26-year-old repeatedly delivered when Denver rushed to double-team Durant and Booker.“Shamet gave them a third scoring option, and he was a huge part of them winning this game,” Nuggets Coach Michael Malone said. “They made us pay for putting two on the ball.”Williams’s other key shift was reducing starting center Deandre Ayton’s minutes in favor of backup Jock Landale. This adjustment paid huge dividends: The Suns were plus-26 with Landale and minus-17 with Ayton across Games 3 and 4. Landale, a 27-year-old Australian in his second NBA season, was outmuscled at times by Jokic, but his low-usage style and mobility make him a good fit alongside Phoenix’s stars. De-emphasizing Ayton also created more room inside and reduced the number of clunky possessions that sometimes result from force-feeding scoring opportunities to the 2018 No. 1 pick. What’s more, Landale’s steady energy stood in contrast to Ayton’s wavering interest.Taken together, this was a case of Phoenix following best practices rather than executing an unconventional overhaul. The Suns put the ball in their best players’ hands more often, increased the space around them and put greater emphasis on the three-point shot. The approach bore similarities to Durant’s Brooklyn tenure, when the Nets constructed a lethal offense by surrounding him and Irving with floor-spacers and a mobile center in Nic Claxton. As this 2-2 series shifts to Denver for Tuesday’s Game 5, it remains unclear whether the Suns can get enough consistent contributions from their supporting cast to upset the top-seeded Nuggets. Regardless, Phoenix’s impromptu evolution into a faster and looser team should shape its next phase of roster building.Paul’s fit with Durant and Booker is not a complete dealbreaker like Russell Westbrook’s doomed experience with the Los Angeles Lakers, but the veteran guard has slipped as an outside shooter and on-ball defender. In trying to imagine how the Suns consistently compete for titles beyond this season, it’s hard to see how they can fill out a championship-worthy rotation while paying $30.8 million to Paul and $32.5 million to Ayton in 2023-24.Remember, the Suns parted with three forwards — Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson and Jae Crowder — in the Durant trade, thinning their wing corps and compromising their frontcourt versatility. Some or all of the money owed to Paul and Ayton would be better allocated to players who could fill in those gaps and fortify the roster to withstand the grind of future postseasons, just as the Lakers turned Westbrook’s contract into D’Angelo Russell and Jarred Vanderbilt.Parting with Paul eventually will be a painful but necessary step for Phoenix to enter its next era. Whenever that happens, the “Point God” will leave the Suns a lot better than he found them.Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

      "title": "What is Willson Contreras doing wrong? The Cardinals just won’t say.",
      "text": "CHICAGO — Willson Contreras, surrounded by reporters in the visitors’ dugout at Wrigley Field on Monday, said he tried not to circle May 8 on his calendar. He did not want to focus too much on his return as a member of the archrival St. Louis Cardinals, to think too much about what might have been if the Cubs hadn’t gone in another direction. He said that he was excited to see old teammates, that he wondered how the fans would receive him. In some alternate universe, all of that emotion might have been the biggest thing Contreras had to worry about Monday.But in this universe, the Cardinals (11-24) are in the midst of their worst start in 50 years. Over the weekend, they managed to make Contreras the focal point of their implosion by calling up a third catcher, signaling that someone other than Contreras will be their starter for the foreseeable future and then not explaining why.So with a horde of reporters waiting for him at Wrigley, Contreras found himself answering much more uncomfortable questions than whether he thought Cubs fans would boo him — questions such as, for example, why the team that signed him in December to be its catcher for the next five years no longer wants him to be its catcher today.“They’re not saying that,” Contreras corrected when asked one such question. “The first thing I asked before I signed here is how transparent we are, how transparent the St. Louis Cardinals are. I haven’t heard one person telling me I won’t be behind the plate or we don’t want you to catch anymore. I don’t think that’s the case.”Indeed, the Cardinals — through Manager Oli Marmol’s public comments, through longtime ace Adam Wainwright’s lengthy spiel in Contreras’s defense Monday, through the $87.5 million they committed in the offseason — insist they have faith in the 30-year-old as their catcher for the five-year duration of that deal. But the team signaled otherwise when it moved him to designated hitter ahead of Wainwright’s first start of the season Saturday.“I think from now on, we have a really good plan to have me catching behind the plate sometime soon,” Contreras said Monday. “That doesn’t mean I’m not a St. Louis Cardinal catcher, as many people think that I’m not going to catch anymore. It’s not that way. We have a really good plan to have me catch sometime soon, and we’re just following that. The problem for the Cardinals is that no one, including Contreras, is willing to say why he needs a plan at all. St. Louis faced Contreras over and over for seven seasons when he was a Cub. He is hitting the way he usually hits. Over the weekend, Marmol praised his pregame work, but Contreras laughed when a reporter told him so Monday.“Oh, man,” he said after some chuckling. “I always do my homework. I do my homework. I do my preparation. I do my talk. I communicate what I see. I don’t think it’s that. I think it’s more than that. It’s hard for me to explain right now.”An amateur detective might look at the fact that mostly the same group of Cardinals starters who owned a 3.92 ERA in 2022 are pitching to a 5.33 ERA entering Monday’s series opener and wonder if the organization thinks Contreras isn’t calling games as well as the man he’s replacing, retired franchise icon Yadier Molina.A capable sleuth might have noted right-hander Jack Flaherty’s comments last week about the Cardinals’ struggles to put away hitters with two strikes, combined those with the fact that Cardinals pitchers are allowing the highest batting average (.216) and second-highest OPS (.651) in those counts, and concluded that the Cardinals are blaming Contreras for the disconnect.“We gave up plenty of runs in the last couple games without Willson behind the plate. I don’t think that’s the point of this,” Marmol said. “The point is we have a guy that is highly, highly, highly passionate about leading behind the plate. We’ve done that well for a long time here with [Molina]. And there’s a process that we’re accustomed to.”Wainwright said Monday that he wasn’t part of the decision to pull Contreras from behind the plate and that he would throw to Contreras in his next start without a problem. He told a crowd of reporters in Wrigley’s tiny visitors’ clubhouse that he wanted to share something instead of obfuscating.“We sat him down yesterday and just poured into him. We love this guy. We’re glad he’s here. We want him to be our guy,” Wainwright said. “No one’s giving up hope on Willy — that was the main message we wanted to share with him.”That message was necessary because chaos ensued this weekend when the Athletic reported Saturday that the Cardinals would play Contreras in the outfield more and use him behind the plate less. By the next day, team president John Mozeliak was telling the same outlet that there would be no outfield experiment after all, that instead the team would let Contreras serve as the designated hitter until he did whatever it needed him to do.Bryce Harper is back. Will the hard-charging Phillies return, too?The Cardinals could have let Contreras figure things out behind the plate while, well, working behind the plate. But Marmol said the organization decided the best course of action was to “attack it straight on,” even if letting him catch would have meant fewer questions about what exactly he was doing wrong.“That’s the part that unfortunately I won’t disclose. That’s the part that will continue to not make sense to the rest of the world. I’ll wear it till then,” Marmol said. “... But we do feel confident in the end product.”What will the difference between Willson Contreras, end product, and Willson Contreras, three-time all-star and prize signing of the Cardinals’ offseason, be? Again, no one will say. But the process will certainly not result in Contreras transforming into the second coming of the defensive wizard Molina, no matter how much St. Louis prays for that miracle.“Yadier Molina [spent the] last 20 years in one organization, and the whole organization is used to his work — I would say that,” Contreras said. “I knew it was going to be a big challenge — it was going to be a huge challenge. I love to be challenged. That’s one thing that I don’t shy away from it.”The time might allow Contreras to get to know his starters better and to adjust to the pitch clock, which has required him to implement still-new pitching plans at unprecedented in-game speed. Contreras skipped the World Baseball Classic to spend all of spring training with the Cardinals’ pitching staff — but not all of the Cardinals’ pitching staff skipped the WBC to spend all of spring training with him.Contreras and Marmol acknowledged that the pitch clock is forcing him to implement unfamiliar pitching plans at unprecedented speed. But other organizations have new catchers, too. They seem to be adapting fine. Then again, none of them are playing for an annual playoff contender that started the season 14 games under .500.“This looks reactive, and it’ll sound like s--- when I say it,” Marmol continued, “but I think it’s actually proactive.”He hinted that Contreras will spend games sitting next to him on the bench, chatting with other starters, things like that. But he would not hint at what must change before Contreras can catch again.“Would a possibility of him continuing to catch and us going down the road we felt like we were going down turn out worse than what we’re discussing right now?” Marmol said, acknowledging that this approach has stirred fan uproar. “My answer to that is potentially yes — in the long run.”",

      "title": "Analysis | The real reason Mexico suddenly dominates global beer exports",
      "text": "After the Great Recession, the Dutch had a solid grip on the global beer market, powered by Holland hop heavyweight Heineken. But within a decade, the Netherlands — indeed, all of Europe’s hoppy heartland — would be unceremoniously thrashed by a New World upstart: Mexico.Today, Mexico ships out more than twice as much beer as any other country and single-handedly accounts for 30 percent of the world’s entire export-beer market, according to Geneva-based trade statistics provider Trade Data Monitor. That puts Mexico far above the Netherlands (14 percent), Belgium (13 percent) and even Oktoberfest progenitor Germany (9 percent).How in the world did Mexico pull off this brew coup?A trail of booze clues would eventually lead us to an antitrust success story from the Obama administration. But it started, as these things often do, with market share.The United States is the world’s largest beer importer, accounting for almost 2 out of every 5 cross-border beer dollars. About 80 percent of that money goes to Mexico. That’s up from a paltry 17 percent in the early 1990s. For Mexico, the United States has become the only market that matters. In a recent 12-month span, 97 percent of Mexican beer exports flowed north across the border.After Mexico, America’s next-biggest sources of suds are the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada, Germany and Belgium. Until very recently, Belgium was third, but Belgian exports to the United States evaporated in 2021 as Stella Artois’s current owners, AB InBev, started brewing the ubiquitous Flemish pilsner in breweries scattered throughout these United States. (The company says it has made significant investments in U.S. breweries to ensure the beer’s quality.)Even in an ultra-consolidated industry, AB InBev stands out as a border- and brand-straddling colossus. Based in Belgium, it operates in almost 50 countries, owns more than 500 brands and sells something like 1 in every 4 beers worldwide. And it’s but one tentacle of 3G Capital, a Brazilian-led juggernaut that has swept up everything from Burger King and Popeyes to Kraft and Heinz foods.3G now owns less than a fifth of the publicly traded AB InBev and plays in many other high-volume consumer businesses. But its big moves started — as many big moves do — with beer.3G’s Brazilian-born leader, Jorge Paulo Lemann, doesn’t strike us as a beer guy; he’s a onetime top-tier tennis player who reportedly doesn’t drink. But according to “The Beer Monopoly,” our guide to much of this history, he looked around Latin America, saw that many of the richest men owned breweries and realized they couldn’t all be business geniuses. It seemed much more likely that brewing was simply a money machine.He soon bought a piece of that money machine and cranked it into high gear, gathering up major Brazilian and Argentine breweries, then storming the Old World. In 2004, he went after Stella maker Interbrew and combined it with AmBev to form InBev. Four years later, he was on the march again, launching a hostile takeover of the King of Brewers, Missouri’s Anheuser-Busch.The behemoth now known as AB InBev was officially the biggest brewer in the world, applying its formula of laying off workers, slashing costs and juicing profits in every hemisphere. But Lemann and friends weren’t satisfied. They already owned part of Grupo Modelo, which then sold the majority of the beer in Mexico. But in 2012, they launched a $20.1 billion bid to buy all of it, taking over a dominant brewer in the largest market in the Spanish-speaking world.That global deal had serious local consequences in the United States. The Justice Department’s antitrust division was not keen on letting AB InBev add Mexico’s Corona, Pacifico and Modelo to domestic stalwarts Budweiser, Busch and Michelob. That would give AB InBev the majority of the U.S. beer trade.U.S. regulators sued and, as part of the eventual settlement, forced AB InBev to sell Modelo’s American export business, including what is now one of the world’s biggest breweries near Piedras Negras, just across the Texas border. Conveniently, an optimal buyer was waiting in the wings.New York-based Constellation Brands, then known for Robert Mondavi wine and Svedka vodka, had been selling Corona and other beers in the United States for years in partnership with Modelo.“Constellation had already set up a well-working and successful import business,” said Ina Verstl, a Germany-based journalist who co-wrote “The Beer Monopoly.” “All they needed were breweries in Mexico.”The smaller American firm seized the opportunity. Then-CEO Rob Sands called the $4.75 billion deal to take full control of the United States’ Grupo Modelo business “truly transformational” and “a significant milestone in our history and participation in the beer business.”The transformation has been as rapid as it was sweeping. Grupo Modelo beers have nigh on conquered America in a decade under Constellation, which — unlike AB InBev — had no reason to tiptoe around Bud Light’s market share. Constellation was aggressive in seeking to broaden its advertising beyond the traditional Mexican American customer base, hiring the likes of Snoop Dogg, Bad Bunny and Andy Samberg to sit on a beach hawking Corona.Its top beer, Modelo Especial, which touts its “fighting spirit,” soon leapfrogged competitor after competitor to become America’s No. 2 beer (by dollar volume). And Modelo is on track to pass AB InBev’s crown jewel, Bud Light, as America’s rey de las cervezas by 2030, according to Bryan Roth, editor of Feel Goods Co.’s alcoholic beverage newsletter, Sightlines Plus.“Constellation is very good at selling Mexican imports,” said beer journalist Kate Bernot, who has reported on these trends for Sightlines and contributed articles on craft beer and something called canned hard coffee to The Washington Post. “Once Americans began squeezing lime wedges into Corona longnecks, these brands became synonymous with relaxation, vacations and a bit more attitude than the standard American lagers that had dominated for decades.”“It also doesn’t hurt that Constellation is aligned with Reyes Beer Division, the country’s largest beer wholesaler,” Bernot said. “Reyes has an especially robust sales network in California, which is not only the country’s largest beer market but is also a stronghold for Mexican imports.”Wine and liquor are now afterthoughts in Constellation earnings calls, as about 80 percent of the company’s sales come from Mexican beer. Executives say Constellation is rapidly adding market share throughout the country, and Modelo Especial is now bigger in its California heartland than Coors Light, Miller Lite, Bud Light and Budweiser combined.Despite a tangled ownership situation that forced regulators to use some unusual tactics, the Constellation deal has become a sparkling symbol of antitrust success: Instead of giving AB InBev the majority of the American beer market, regulators helped create a truly formidable American competitor.And that’s why President Barack Obama’s Justice Department is (at least partly) responsible for the six-pack of Modelo in your refrigerator right now.“The U.S. beer industry is competitive and dynamic,” AB InBev told us via email, “with more choices available to consumers than ever before.”Hi again! The Department of Data is looking for quantifiable questions. What are you curious about? The demographics that best predict who will become an inventor? Is it just us, or are fewer people wearing neck braces these days? Where do lifeguards come from? Just ask!If your question inspires a column, we’ll send you an official Department of Data button and ID card.",

      "title": "Tiger Woods’s ex-girlfriend alleges sexual harassment in escalating dispute",
      "text": "Tiger Woods’s ex-girlfriend claimed in a court filing that the golfer began dating her when she was his employee, forced her to sign a nondisclosure agreement to keep her job and used a trick by an attorney to break up with her and kick her out of their home.The allegations stem from an escalating court dispute that is heading to a hearing Tuesday to determine whether the ex-girlfriend, Erica Herman, is bound by the NDA and barred from suing Woods in open court. Woods’s lawyers have argued Herman is in violation of the agreement, which requires them to settle all disputes in confidential arbitration.Herman’s lawyer has argued that her court claim against Woods was covered by a federal act negating NDAs in relation to alleged victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment. The lawyer, Benjamin Hodas, wrote in a new filing Friday in circuit civil court in Martin County, Fla., that Woods predicated her employment, and later her housing status, on her relationship with him, which constituted sexual harassment.“Tiger Woods, the internationally renowned athlete and one of the most powerful figures in global sports, decided to pursue a sexual relationship with his employee, then — according to him — forced her to sign an NDA about it or else be fired from her job,” the new filing reads. “And, when he became disgruntled with their sexual relationship, he tricked her into leaving her home, locked her out, took her cash, pets, and personal possessions, and tried to strong-arm her into signing a different NDA.”From March: Tiger Woods’s ex-girlfriend wants NDA nullified amid couple’s breakupWoods’s agent, Mark Steinberg, did not respond to an email seeking comment Monday. One of Woods’s attorneys in the dispute, J.B. Murray, did not respond to messages seeking comment. In court documents, Woods’s attorneys have called Herman a “jilted ex-girlfriend who wants to publicly litigate.”In Friday’s filing, Hodas said that stance by Woods’s representatives was “taken from the classic playbook of powerful men accused of sexual harassment who respond by belittling and insulting their victims.”The filing alleges Woods began a romantic relationship with Herman in 2015, years earlier than he had previously said, and when she was director of operations for his restaurant, The Woods Jupiter.On Aug. 9, 2017, according to a copy of a contract filed by Woods’s attorneys, Herman signed an NDA, and their relationship became public from that point forward, with Herman attending Woods’s tournaments and posing for photographs with him and his children. Hodas pointed out that the NDA was signed on the same day Woods signed a plea deal shelving a much-publicized DUI case against him.Hodas wrote that Herman does not recall signing the contract filed in court. But the lawyer noted that the document appeared to link her relationship with Woods and her job at the restaurant. The contract states Herman was signing the NDA in “consideration for the opportunity to continue to ... spend time with Eldrick ‘Tiger’ Woods” and “be employed at the restaurant known as The Woods Jupiter.”“Mr. Woods was Ms. Herman’s boss,” Hodas wrote. “On Mr. Woods’s own portrayal of events, he imposed an NDA on her as a condition to keep her job when she began having a sexual relationship with him. A boss imposing different work conditions on his employee because of their sexual relationship is sexual harassment.”Emails filed in court by Woods’s attorneys show that when presented with an NDA in 2017 by Christopher Hubman, Woods’s chief financial officer, Herman responded that her “only concern” was “if by chance [Woods] does something that brings our relationship to an end, do I automatically [lose] my job?”“I don’t have any problems with what’s in the document because I wouldn’t go public or use anything I know to hurt him or the kids but with my whole life in his hands now I would want to have some kind of control over my future in the business,” Herman wrote. “If something happened 5-10 years down the road I don’t want to be in my 40s heartbroken and jobless.”Hubman replied: “In my mind, your employment by The Woods Jupiter and your personal relationship with TW are two separate items. I don’t think the end of one automatically impacts the other ... although I admit it could be complicated.”Herman ultimately quit working at the restaurant, according to Hodas, under pressure from Woods to “devote herself full-time to their relationship and caring for him and his children.” But in October 2022, the court filing claims, Woods told Herman they were going to the Bahamas, and she packed a small bag. But when they got to an airport where a private jet was waiting, according to Herman, Woods instead told her to speak with his attorney and left.That lawyer — who the court filing says calls himself “Ray Donovan with a pen,” referring to the fictional fixer on television — “told her that she was not going anywhere, would never see Mr. Woods again, had been locked out of the house, and could not return,” Hodas claimed. “She would not even be able to see the children or her pets again.”From April: For Tiger Woods, limping and last at the Masters, every step was a struggleHodas claimed Woods’s attorney employed “brutish and high-pressure tactics” to try to get Herman to sign an additional NDA and arbitration agreement, but she refused. Michael D. Holtz, a California attorney who promotes himself on his website as “Ray Donovan with a pen,” did not respond to a request seeking comment.Hodas argued that by breaking Herman’s tenancy agreement with Woods’s trust that owns the mansion where he and his children live, Woods “made the availability of her housing conditional on her having sexual relationship with a co-tenant” — which Hodas called sexual harassment.In October, Herman sued the trust, alleging that she was unlawfully evicted from her home and that the trust’s “agents” had “misappropriated in excess of $40,000 in cash that belonged to her” while “making scurrilous and defamatory allegations about how she obtained the money.”After Woods’s attorneys responded that she could not sue because of the terms of her NDA, Herman filed another lawsuit seeking to invalidate the agreement. Hodas has cited a federal act — the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, or EFAA — that was signed into law by President Biden last year. The law invalidated NDAs that caused disputes in those cases to be handled in confidential arbitration.“While Ms. Herman may well be entitled to compensation under a sexual harassment claim, she has not brought this case to recover a cent in damages from Mr. Woods,” Hodas’s filing reads. “But the EFAA still protects her.”",

      "text": "The Indianapolis Colts asked the NFL to look into possible tampering involving the Washington Commanders and retired quarterback Andrew Luck, a person familiar with the situation said Monday.The Colts’ request follows a report that the Commanders considered Luck as a quarterback option last season.Luck, a four-time Pro Bowl selection in six seasons with the Colts, retired abruptly from the NFL just before the 2019 season at 29, describing himself as “exhausted” from dealing with injuries. The Colts continue to hold his NFL rights.Under league rules, his contract rolls over, and he would remain under contract to the Colts if he were to resume his career. He never has given any indication that he plans to return to the NFL, but any team interested in attempting to convince him otherwise first would have to receive permission from the Colts.NFL is talking with Daniel Snyder reps; sale approval could come in stagesThe Commanders did not contact Luck, his father or his uncle who has served as his agent, according to a person within Luck’s camp. However, a person familiar with the Colts’ position said the team wants the NFL to determine whether there was improper contact through intermediaries. The Colts do not want the situation to be dismissed without being properly investigated, according to that person.The Commanders and the NFL declined to comment.ESPN reported over the weekend that the Commanders had “even phoned the retired Andrew Luck” in 2022 before they traded for Carson Wentz. A subsequent version of ESPN’s report said the Commanders had “even phoned about retired Andrew Luck.”If any NFL Team,attempted to contact Andrew Luck (or any associate of him)… to play for their Franchise - it would be a clear Violation of the League’s Tampering Policy.Colts owner Jim Irsay responded Sunday on social media.“If any NFL Team, attempted to contact Andrew Luck (or any associate of him) … to play for their Franchise — it would be a clear Violation of the League’s Tampering Policy,” Irsay wrote on Twitter.In August, the NFL suspended and fined Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and stripped the team of two draft choices after concluding that the Dolphins committed tampering violations involving quarterback Tom Brady and Sean Payton, the Super Bowl-winning coach for the New Orleans Saints now with the Denver Broncos.The league suspended Ross through mid-October, temporarily removed him from all league committees and fined him $1.5 million. The Dolphins lost their first-round pick in last month’s draft and a third-round selection next year.The Colts’ request comes with the NFL and team owners considering approval of Josh Harris’s tentative $6.05 billion deal to purchase the Commanders from Daniel Snyder. Irsay said in October that the owners should seriously consider voting to remove Snyder from ownership of the Commanders.",

      "title": "Will Amazon Style pick out everyone’s clothes? It’s already happening.",
      "text": "A previous version of this article did not include a response from Amazon Style about claims that customer reviews on its site have been manipulated. A response has been added. In addition, a previous version incorrectly said that Amazon Storefront surpassed its competitors as the predominant affiliate link program in relation to its reach with influencers. It became a must-join affiliate link program among influencers. The article has been corrected. COLUMBUS, Ohio — What if the world looked like all those sponsored ads you see all the time? Thumbs-up, Shop now, or I’m not interested in this ad?Too late, we’re already here, on a drizzly Friday morning in a sleek, shopping mall dressing room accented with touch screens. Along with the outfits I’ve picked out for myself at the Amazon Style store in Columbus — the brand’s second in-person clothing store in the country — an algorithm had selected a few items of clothing it thought I might like, all placed in the room by unseen hands via a double-sided closet. Sponsored content (“sponcon,” if you will) has taken over the physical realm.It knew my size, what I was looking for (some cute summer dresses) and a little bit about my style (classic, minimalist, not boho). Inside the dressing room, a touch screen bearing my name offered a carousel of other choices that could be sent to the room. It felt a little like swiping through Cher Horowitz’s famous “Clueless” closet.What the algorithm did not know was that I look absolutely wretched in medium-beige, the color of one dress it had selected just for me. Another pick, a red floral dress, looked like the kind of thing a TikTok influencer would wear — but on closer inspection it was cheaply made, with plasticky fabric and poorly constructed seams. Data cannot substitute for quality or replace taste.That makes Amazon Style an IRL microcosm of the online Amazon shopping experience: Equal parts convenient and incoherent, full of hits and misses, with a wide-ranging selection driven by computer science and profit, sometimes to the detriment of style itself. The store displays a curated selection of higher-end brands, Amazon brands and those third-party sellers with unpronounceable alphabet soup names, like BTFBM and Floerns, all of which would come up in your search results if you went to the site to find a dress. In person, as with the app, you may or may not be satisfied by the quality of the results.Amazon clothes have never been more popular. In 2021, it became the No. 1 clothing retailer in America by market share, surpassing competitors Target and Walmart, as well as department stores like Macy’s, MarketWatch reported. If you are a woman, the algorithm has probably populated your feed with countless posts extolling the “100 best under-$100 spring fashion finds from Amazon” (InStyle Magazine), or the “33 best Amazon clothes and fashion finds” (Teen Vogue), or the “20 fashion pieces with great reviews on Amazon” (USA Today). And then there are the influencers who might pop up in your For You page on TikTok, or your suggested Instagram reels: “Amazon swimsuits $35 and under.” “Amazon going-out tops try-on haul.” “When you find the perfect corset on Amazon.”(Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, but Amazon did not influence the content of this story. No free going-out tops here.)So many finds, and yet we still seek. What is happening with Amazon Style — the store, and also the concept? Some interesting, wearisome, surprising things. Some influential, influencer things. Come with us, on a search for dresses and answers.It all may have started with the Amazon Coat. In 2018, New York Magazine’s The Strategist reported on a puffer coat that fashionable Upper East Side women were buying in droves — the kind of women who ordinarily buy Balenciaga. A nondescript brand called Orolay, which also makes folding chairs and storage cabinets, had a viral fast-fashion hit.Suddenly, it was acceptable — and maybe kinda cool — to buy clothes in the same virtual shopping cart as a dog bed and a multi-pack of toothpaste.But it’s a shopping experience with as many pros as there are cons. Benefits include the fast Prime shipping, the generous return policy, the “Try Before You Buy” program (where shoppers are shipped their selections without charge, and given seven days to decide what to keep) and the endless choices. For drawbacks, there’s the variable quality of third party sellers, the inscrutable brand names of unknown origins, the company’s social and environmental impact, the manipulated customer reviews and, again, the endless choices. (“We have zero tolerance for fake reviews,” an Amazon spokeswoman says.)Among them are well-established brands such as Levi’s, Gap and Sam Edelman — usually a safe bet — as well as Amazon’s house brands, which can be a mixed bag, but have devoted fans. You can buy a $20,000 Elie Saab gown on Amazon, or a $5 tank top. In the course of browsing, you will encounter some of the most hideous garments you have ever seen.Even if you find something nice, it will be functional, not aspirational. Amazon is for buying clothes that are just good enough, or close enough to looking like some other, fancier brand, or shipped quickly enough to get here before your cousin’s engagement party this weekend.“They’re just appealing to the average American that wants to get a good enough quality of clothing that doesn’t really care about name brands,” says Diana Smith, associate director of retail and e-commerce for the market research firm Mintel.But there is a way to weed through it all: a multitude of stylish helpers who have seemingly sorted through the tens of thousands of summer dresses on the site, from ANRABESS to Zattcas, with all the Huhots and Yathons in between. Amazon has considerably upped its influencer game. Even the most famous influencers, the ones who get deals with luxury brands, all seem to be shilling for the platform lately.Influencers be like “I found the cure to cancer!!! Go to my Amazon storefront😍link in bio”Like Lindsay Silberman. She’s a luxury lifestyle blogger with approximately 200,000 Instagram followers and a scented candle brand. She has posted shopping trips to Fendi and Prada, and sponsored content featuring high-end hotels and Dior makeup. And also, Amazon.“Anything that is just like, classic, simple, and when you look at it, you would never guess that it was from Amazon — those are things that perform best for me,” she says. “I know that’s where a lot of my followers shop.”Silberman, 36, curates an Amazon Influencer Storefront — a page on Amazon that collects all of her recommendations and breaks them into categories to make it easy for her fans to shop her picks. Pretty much every influencer has one.“Basically, Amazon is becoming a social media platform,” says Federico Mangio, an Italian researcher who has studied affiliate marketing programs. “You can post stories, you can have your storefront, you can advertise products.”“I really handle my Amazon storefront as a boutique. You can really customize it,” says Niecy Vaughan, 31, an influencer who specializes in Amazon finds. She has nearly 1,500 suggested products on hers, most of which she models herself in photos and live try-on videos. “I try and take that stigma out of Amazon being some[where] that, you know, everything can be bad quality,” she says.Sarah Allmon and Leah Brzyski, the 29-year-old twin-sister influencers who post as Two Scoops of Style, “really do love finding those pieces on Amazon,” says Allmon. “We kind of make it our mission to find those really good quality pieces that are going to last you more than just a couple wears.”Of course, these influencers aren’t weeding through Amazon for cool outfit ideas out of the goodness of their hearts. Most consumers know that influencers earn commission through affiliate links, often through sites such as LTK (formerly Like to Know It). But sometime in the past few years, Amazon Storefront became a must-join affiliate link program, thanks to its ambitious recruitment of influencers and a sweeter commission deal than many other sites. So many TikTokers are sending people to their Amazon Storefront that the phrase has become an cliched punchline on social media.“Influencers are their best advertisers” — for both the merchandise and the program itself, says Alison Gary, 48, who started her blog Wardrobe Oxygen in 2005 and is an Amazon Influencer. “If we’re promoting it all the time, other influencers are like, ‘This must be something good.’ And they have a higher acceptance than a lot of other affiliate programs.” (An Amazon spokeswoman declined to share details about the program’s acceptance rate.)Instagram is a mall, and this actual, physical mall in Ohio — Easton Town Center — is, instead, a “premier shopping, dining, and entertainment destination,” which means there’s a Hot Topic store within walking distance of a Gucci store, just as a $10,000 dress is a click away from a $6 one. Most influencers haven’t set foot in a physical Amazon Style store, but with one look around at the claw clips and beaded bucket handbags and strappy square-toed sandals, their presence can be deeply felt.It’s time to break down how this all works, and what it is doing to fashion.If someone buys a dress an influencer has recommended on their storefront, they earn a percentage of the revenue on that sale — anywhere between 1 to 10 percent, depending on the item. But what makes the Amazon Influencer program popular is that they also earn a commission on any other products the person buys — even if the person doesn’t even buy the dress that made them click through in the first place. “The halo effect can last up to 24 hours,” an Amazon spokeswoman confirmed.Influencers can also see what people are buying in their commission reports.“Nobody buys just a dress. They buy a dress, and they buy batteries, and they buy laundry detergent and they buy dog treats,” says Gary. She looked over one of her recent reports: “Somebody bought hearts of romaine. I clearly didn’t link to that. We can see that kind of stuff.”Because of enormous quantity of products available on Amazon, influencers can make a lot of money this way. Vaughan, for example, is her family’s breadwinner: She says she makes 99 percent of her income through the Amazon Influencer program, and earns in the low six figures. Amazon declined to share how much the company pays influencers each year.There are other benefits. Influencers spoke to The Post about special perks like free products, one-on-one business coaching from Amazon and gift cards for “buying things to then try out and share with our audience,” says Brzyski. Amazon also shares data on products that are performing well, and its influencers can earn bonuses through a program called Creator Commissions, which is “sponsored by brands that sell on Amazon” who want to launch a campaign to promote their products, says a spokeswoman. (“We have a variety of incentive and compensation structures, including gift cards,” an Amazon spokeswoman told The Post.)“You’re constantly being motivated to sell more,” says Gary.Previously, influencers considered the Nordstrom anniversary sale to be “the Super Bowl of swipe-ups,” says Stephanie McNeal, the author of “Swipe Up for More!: Inside the Unfiltered Lives of Influencers.” It was a huge moneymaker, but “a couple of influencers told me last year that that has completely flipped, where now their biggest day of the year is Prime Day,” Amazon’s once-a-year mega-sale.Good influencers generally only recommend things they’ve set their eyes on — followers are fickle; trust is key to retaining them — but some people admit that they just put anything on their storefront.  And it’s not just individuals doing it. Media organizations are using affiliate links and creating content that encourages people to click and buy. That’s why we all keep getting sucked into those BuzzFeed (or Teen Vogue, or PopSugar, or USA Today, etc.) lists of “finds.” Amazon declined to comment on its relationship with specific publishers.It is a strategy that is paying off: In its 2022 third-quarter earnings conference call for shareholders, BuzzFeed cited affiliate link revenue from Amazon Prime Day as a source of growth. According to its 2022 fourth-quarter shareholder earnings release, the New York Times’s “revenues increased 12.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of higher Wirecutter affiliate revenues.” (And hey, us too: The Post uses Amazon affiliate links in its Book World section, an arrangement that predates Bezos’s ownership of the paper.)It exposes a bit of a double standard, says McNeal. “I feel like influencers still have a ton of stigma and there is this real bias against, like, ‘Look at them just like shilling random stuff on Amazon,’” she says. But then “the New York Times realized they can make a ton of money doing this and now are doing it, and that’s not considered, like, non-prestigious.”But back to those cheap dresses. Any retailer with that much market share has the ability to shape the way people think about clothing and fashion.“You don’t think about Amazon as being a fashion icon. But that’s exactly what they’re trying to change,” says Smith. “The share would indicate that that’s working.”And it’s working not just despite the fact that influencers are filling people’s feeds with cheaply-made fast fashion — it’s working because of it.There are two reasons. One is because of the vast choices available on Amazon, many of which are copycats, or dupes, of more expensive name brands. Amazon “makes it easy to be brand agnostic,” says McNeal, offering an example from this winter: “It’s like, all of a sudden everyone on Instagram or TikTok is wearing a plaid shacket. And I think where Amazon really thrives in the situation is if all the influencers … instead of saying, ‘Hey, you need to go to Abercrombie and buy this specific jacket,’” just offer a variety of well-priced options that are good enough, she says. “On a personal level, I literally went to Amazon and searched and just found one that had good reviews and was cheap.”And cheap is reason No. 2.“The people who are swiping at one o’clock in the morning, they’ll buy that,” says Gary. “They’re not going to buy the $50 dress, the $100 dress, even if it’s like, higher quality, it’s sustainable, it gives back, it’s a woman-owned business, it’s locally-owned. You know, it could be all these wonderful things. Gets a thousand positive reviews, size inclusive. It’s the best thing in the world. And you’re like, ‘This is the best thing in the world.’ And the value is actually fantastic for the quality and the brand and everything. Crickets. But you’re like, ‘Here’s this piece of crap. It’s really super cute and it’s less than 20 bucks’. Hundreds of people will buy it. So it’s that impulse buy.”This sets off what seems to be an endless feedback loop of purchases: An influencer promotes a product, which makes more people buy it, which makes more influencers feature it — some, with Amazon’s coaxing — which makes more people buy it. The cycle repeats itself with every micro-trend: Shackets, Skims-esque bodycon dresses, cargo pants, lug-sole loafers. It’s an ouroboros of commerce.And: “It’s basically another way for Amazon to kind of collect data about what’s resonating with shoppers that they can in turn use to create more of their own private label brands,” says Smith.Which brings us back to Amazon Style, the store, where the music was thumping and the racks were full of floral summer dresses. But only one of each, rather than the multiple sizes you’d find in most stores: If you want to try on an outfit, you’ll have to scan a QR code on the hanger, which will send your size to a dressing room. There are no price tags, either. The hanger displays a price range — given Amazon’s fluctuating prices, you won’t know exactly how much an item costs until you select it.It takes about 10 minutes before the dressing room is stocked with your selections, which continue to arrive while you’re in there, via a double-sided door. And you’ll be surprised by other items, too: picks from Amazon’s algorithm, like my beige dress. Some of its other selections, like a black sweetheart neckline dress, were actually pretty spot-on. It’s a “retail activation,” to use the parlance of marketers — the kind of thing that justifies paying rent on a physical store, because it makes shopping a destination.But seeing Amazon clothes in person before you buy them isn’t necessarily a good thing. To borrow another concept from “Clueless,” some of the Amazon outfits are “a full-on Monet,” as Cher Horowitz says: “From far away, it’s okay, but up close, it’s a big old mess.”Amazon’s decision to feature some of these brands in its stores — one cheap-looking dress I saw had a tag that just said “Fashion” as its brand — might certainly spur the kind of impulse purchases Gary described. But in other cases, I recognized pieces that I had seen online that photographed well and looked good on influencers but which, in real life, had uneven seams, or were see-through because they lacked lining, or were made of itchy poly blends.“Even though some of these items don’t appear to be very quality, maybe they’re selling” well online, says Smith of Mintel. “It just really looks like they’re using their stores to experiment.”But it’s also that, lately, people don’t seem to care as much if their clothes are well-made, especially if they’re cheap and photograph well. Smith says Mintel has found that customers are largely satisfied with clothing they’ve bought on Amazon.I bought two dresses. Not the ones the algorithm picked for me. But a navy slip dress, and a pink summer puff-sleeve with a tie-front and a midriff cutout, both from the Drop, the Amazon house brand I had been seeing on Instagram a lot. Oh, and some faux-pearl barrettes. The rest went back through the dressing room’s double-sided door.Amazon declined to discuss its plans for opening other Amazon Style locations. If it is anything like its Amazon Go grocery stores, we can expect to see more of them. And that’s kind of how Gary thinks about the whole concept of Amazon fashion.“It’s this quick fix. You think it’s going to somehow make you more … like the person who promoted the piece. And rarely does it deliver,” says Gary — acknowledging that, yes, she is the person who promotes the pieces.“What really happens with this promotion of cheap Amazon fashion,” she continues, is “like going to the grocery store when you’re hungry. You end up buying way more than you need.”",

      "title": "Gun that killed Halyna Hutchins on ‘Rust’ set may have been modified",
      "text": "New Mexico prosecutors are investigating whether the gun Alec Baldwin was handling when it went off and killed “Rust” cinematographer Halyna Hutchins might have been intentionally modified.“The modification appears to be related to the notches on the internal portion of the hammer for full cock, half cock and quarter cock positions,” prosecutors wrote in court documents filed this week, which asked the judge to authorize transferring the .45 Long Colt revolver, ammunition and other evidence collected from the film set to a ballistics expert for forensic testing. “It appears that these notches may have been partially removed or ground down so that they are less prominent.”The development comes a month after prosecutors dropped the criminal case against Baldwin in Hutchins’s October 2021 death. Citing unnamed sources, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time that prosecutors had recently learned about possible modifications to the gun.Charges of involuntary manslaughter were initially brought against Baldwin and “Rust” armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed in late January, with prosecutors alleging that they failed to follow a number of safety measures. Both pleaded not guilty.But parts of the prosecution began to collapse. The Santa Fe district attorney’s office reduced the charges a month later, lessening the potential jail time. It dropped them altogether for Baldwin in April.The criminal case against Gutierrez-Reed is ongoing. The armorer is suing the movie’s ammunition supplier for allegedly providing live ammunition to the film set.According to court documents, Gutierrez-Reed’s attorney, Jason Bowles, has no opposition to the prosecutors’ motion to transfer the gun. If it is found to have been modified, it could bolster Baldwin’s contention that he never pulled the trigger when it discharged, despite FBI tests and expert skepticism claiming otherwise.The bullet struck two people on set with Baldwin during a rehearsal for the western film, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.Special prosecutors Kari T. Morrissey and Jason J. Lewis joined the case in March after district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies stepped down.While it remains uncertain whether a new case could be brought against Baldwin, he faces other legal challenges.On Feb. 9, Hutchins’s family in Ukraine filed a lawsuit against him and others involved in production, alleging battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and loss of consortium, which refers to the impact of Hutchins’s personal relationships caused by her death. Three former crew members sued Baldwin and the film’s producers the same month, asking for damages for “blast injuries” they say they suffered when the gun fired.In a counterclaim he filed for a previous lawsuit in October, Baldwin is suing Gutierrez-Reed and others associated with the film for giving him the loaded gun that killed Hutchins. The suit “seeks to clear his name” and hold the defendants “accountable for their misconduct.”“Rust” filming resumed in April, the same day prosecutors said charges against Baldwin would be dropped. Production moved from its original location in New Mexico to a ranch in Montana.Baldwin posted a selfie to Instagram this week to celebrate the last day of filming, after shaving off the beard he grew for the western.",

      "title": "Perspective | How ‘Succession’ is — and isn’t — about Rupert Murdoch and Fox",
      "text": "“Life,” wrote Oscar Wilde in a famous essay in 1891, “imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.” After 37 episodes of “Succession,” many of us may be forgiven for losing touch with which is which.Take the latest episode: A knife-edge election night, almost too close to call, with suspicion of skulduggery at the ballot boxes. A leading news channel prepares to make a crucial intervention. There are back-channel conversations with the leading candidates. There’s the implication that a timely endorsement could be rewarded with favors down the line.Is that ATN — the right-leaning news network owned by Logan Roy’s media conglomerate Waystar Royco in “Succession” — or Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News?HBO’s dark “comedy” (if that’s the right word), about an aging and ruthless media baron who loves nothing more than making or breaking political careers as his children jostle for pole position when he dies, has long been interpreted as referring to the Murdochs, although showrunner Jesse Armstrong has said that “Succession” is about “no one family.”And in fact, the show’s family dynamics have always resisted the parallel — even if you’d like to think that the ruthless Roman Roy is a version of Lachlan Murdoch, who won his father’s real-life succession battle, or that the conniving Shiv Roy hardly seems to have much in common with Elisabeth Murdoch, who stepped away from the Murdoch empire well before Lachlan’s final ascension.But the corporate-political side of the show has hewed closer to real life, and Sunday’s episode, which played like a rewrite of 2020’s presidential election eve, was the moment when the two storylines finally seemed to melt into a confusing amalgam of documentary and satirical drama.Meanwhile, Murdoch’s flagship channel just a month ago agreed — in actual real life — to a humiliating $787.5 million settlement in a lawsuit over Fox News’s false claims that Donald Trump had been robbed of victory in the 2020 election through rigged voting machines.The pretrial discovery process by the machines’ manufacturer, Dominion Voting Systems, revealed an extraordinary trail of combustible internal emails and texts about the nail-biting night when Fox News’s Decision Desk declared that the key state of Arizona would be won by Joe Biden.The language in some of these communications made “Succession” look quite tame.The post-election lines between the Trump team and the Murdoch operation sizzled with fury and betrayal. Panicked over a loss of viewers to fringier right-wing channels, Fox executives tacitly allowed some of its presenters to spout wild conspiracy theories about a stolen election while knowing them to be utter nonsense, their emails suggest. Lachlan insisted that “the narrative” around a pro-Trump rally on Nov. 14 “should be a huge celebration of the president.”That was real enough, but how could the screenwriters of “Succession,” which started filming this final season in June 2022, have known? The answer is that they most likely couldn’t, or at least not all of it: Their genius is to take real life and pump it up by, say, 20 percent. Only there are moments in the parallel Murdoch story that no screenwriter would dare invent or “improve.”“No brass on the battlefield” was Logan Roy’s dictum before he died, supposedly discouraging family members from appearing on the newsroom floor, much less interfering with crucial editorial judgments. But by the end of “Succession’s” election episode, there was a newsroom invasion of Roy children arguing furiously about whether to call it for Wisconsin and thereby “gift” the momentum, if not the election itself, to alt-right candidate Jeryd Mencken. Who has, as it happens, ingratiated himself with Roman by hinting he might find a way of halting a deal which could take Waystar Royco out of family control.All fiction, right?Stepping gingerly back into real life, let’s remind ourselves that Rupert Murdoch once swore under oath that he had “never asked a prime minister for anything.” That’s what he told the Leveson Inquiry set up to inquire into British journalistic ethics in the wake of the 2011 phone-hacking scandal, which — $1 billion later — is still clogging up the English courts with settlements for victims of intrusion. (They include Prince Harry, who might yet push the case all the way to a full hearing.)No brass on the battlefield. Except that Murdoch also once conceded that “if you want to judge my thinking, look at the Sun.” And the Dominion texts also showed Rupert to be closely involved in Fox’s programming decisions around the election. In other words, the top brass will, indeed, instruct at least parts of the battlefield what to think. The Leveson Inquiry — with all its thousands of pages of testimony and witness statements — was actually a rather good resource for understanding how the real-life Murdoch interacts with editors and politicians. It would have been a rich source of material for “Succession” (according to a recent Vanity Fair profile, part of Murdoch’s recent divorce settlement with Jerry Hall was the stricture that she not give story ideas to the show’s writers; that alone suggests how close to the shore they sailed).There you can read the evidence of Kelvin MacKenzie, one of Murdoch’s most successful newspaper editors, of the tabloid Sun. He told the inquiry about the obeisance that prime ministers would pay to Murdoch and his U.K. chief executive, Rebekah Brooks (later to be acquitted of phone hacking charges and reinstated to run British operations): “There was never a party, a breakfast, a lunch, a cuppa or a drink that [David] Cameron & Co would not turn up to in force if the Great Man or his handmaiden Rebekah Brooks was there. There was always a queue to kiss their rings. It was gut wrenching.”Sounds like the Roy family party depicted in the episode just before this one.Or read the words of another hugely successful former Murdoch editor, Andrew Neil, a loyal lieutenant at both the Sunday Times and Sky. He told Leveson that a Labour minister confided to him that, when it came to two major issues of public policy — Iraq and Europe — “Rupert Murdoch was the 24th member of the Blair cabinet.”Neil said that “Mr. Blair was almost certainly inclined to war anyway; but Mr. Murdoch was a powerful voice propelling him in that direction and overcoming any doubts. I understand that in the last days before the Iraq invasion began Mr. Blair spoke to Mr. Murdoch more often than he spoke to his defence or foreign secretaries.”Just like Logan Roy in his prime.Logan, of course, is no longer with us, and whether “Succession” will choose to wrap up by appointing a new king is an open question. Back to real life where, according to a recent book by Paddy Manning, at least one Wall Street analyst believes that “it would be fair to assume Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies.” Similarly, it’s hard to imagine any of the inept Roy children reigning for long.What is to come when the world’s most powerful media tycoon finally shuffles off this mortal coil?That’s from “Hamlet,” a work of fiction inspired by the medieval legend of Amleth, Prince of Denmark. Who now remembers the original prince? Is it possible that, in years to come, we will remember Logan Roy more than Rupert Murdoch? He somehow seems so much more believable.Alan Rusbridger is editor of Prospect magazine, and was editor in chief of the Guardian for 20 years.",

      "title": "Nebraska passes 12-week abortion, gender-affirming care for minors ban",
      "text": "Conservatives in the Nebraska legislature won just enough votes Friday to pass a combined ban on abortion at 12 weeks and gender-affirming treatment for minors, amid continuing protests at the state Capitol.The bill was a gamble that could have seen both issues shelved for the year, had it failed to win the 33 votes needed to end debate. Instead, conservatives’ novel legislation, billed as a compromise, passed by a vote of 33-15, swaying holdout Republican state Sen. Merv Riepe, who voted for it after blocking a proposed six-week abortion ban last month.Sen. Kathleen Kauth (R), one of the bill’s authors, said it was not motivated by hate, but designed to protect transgender youths.“This bill is and always has been about protecting children. It does not discriminate,” Kauth said, insisting that the measure was meant to delay “irreversible, experimental medications and surgeries.”“This bill is simply about protecting innocent life,” Sen. Tom Briese (R) said, calling the legislation a “reasonable” compromise.But opponents condemned the law as unconstitutional and discriminatory.“This place is morally bankrupt. You are playing political games with the lives of children and parents,” Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh (D) said.Friday’s vote followed the 49-member Republican-dominated legislature’s interim approval of the measure Tuesday. Gov. Jim Pillen (R) has said he will sign the bill and released a statement applauding its passage.“All children deserve a chance to grow and live happy, fruitful lives. This includes pre-born boys and girls, and it includes children struggling with their gender identity,” Pillen said. “These kids deserve the opportunity to grow and explore who they are and want to be, and they can do so without making irreversible decisions.”The abortion ban will take effect immediately, and the transgender care restrictions will begin Oct. 1.The 12-week abortion ban includes exceptions for rape and incest, and to save the life of the pregnant person, but not for fatal fetal anomalies. It does not protect doctors who perform abortions from criminal prosecution.The transgender measure bans gender reassignment surgery for those under 19 years old, Nebraska’s age of majority. It gives the state’s chief medical officer — an ear, nose and throat doctor appointed by the Republican governor — authority over the use of gender-affirming treatments for transgender minors as of October.While the bill contains an exception for minors already receiving puberty blockers or hormone treatments, opponents questioned whether they would be protected given that the bill grants ultimate authority to a conservative political appointee. Efforts to amend the bill to address that were rejected by conservatives.The 12-week abortion ban did not go as far as some in the chamber desired. And an earlier bill on medical treatment for transgender people would have barred minors from receiving puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries. But after extensive debate and “listening sessions” with opponents, Republicans scaled back their goals to win support needed to pass the bill.While the bill’s double-barreled nature is unusual, restrictions on abortion and transgender people have been popular conservative targets in state legislatures this year. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last June, more than a dozen states have imposed abortion bans.This week in North Carolina, a Republican supermajority in the legislature overrode the Democratic governor’s veto to pass a 12-week ban. In April, Florida passed a six-week ban that will outlaw most abortions in the country’s third-most-populous state.More than a dozen states have also passed restrictions on transgender people this year, including Florida and North Carolina. Texas’s Republican-controlled legislature on Wednesday approved a bill banning hormone and puberty-blocking treatments as well as surgeries for transgender minors. The bill would force the state medical board to revoke physician licenses for those who violate the ban, and it would prohibit taxpayer funds from going to any person or entity that “provides or facilitates” the treatment. Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has said he will sign the measure.The erosion of transgender rights has been particularly alarming in Nebraska, the bill’s opponents said. It was here that Brandon Teena, a transgender man, was raped and killed in 1993, a murder that spawned the film “Boys Don’t Cry” and lobbying for LGBTQ hate-crime laws nationwide.“The combination of these two bills is an unprecedented attack on our human and civil rights here in Nebraska,” said Mindy Rush Chipman, interim executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska, who joined protesters at the Capitol on Friday.In a statement after the vote, she said the organization was “exploring our options to address the harm of this extreme legislation.”“This is not over, not by a long shot,” she said.Opponents of the Nebraska bill in the single-chamber legislature accused conservatives of breaking the rules to pander to their base, rushing an abortion ban that would imperil even well-meaning doctors.“You could ensnare a medical provider who is trying to follow the law,” Sen. Danielle Conrad (D) said.The fight led many on both sides of the bill to break with traditions of Midwestern civility that had often allowed them to avoid divisive national politics in the past. Instead, they waged a fierce, emotional and often deeply personal floor debate about the bill.Sen. Megan Hunt, an independent with a 12-year-old transgender son, alternately castigated and pleaded with the bill’s supporters to relent, at times crying openly.“We are in the midst of a time of unprecedented violence for LGBTQ people in our country,” she said. “We are working to fight for rights that we have already won.”Sen. Brad von Gillern (R) accused Hunt and the bill’s other opponents of lying and hate-mongering“You are the epitome of what you claim to be fighting against,” he said.Hundreds of protesters filled the Capitol rotunda outside the legislature, nearly drowning out lawmakers at times with chants, shouts and foot stomping. The chamber’s glass doors were locked, protesters prevented from displaying signs nearby as extra state troopers patrolled. When shouts erupted in the gallery during debate, Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly — who presides over the legislature — called a temporary recess and directed security to clear the gallery.“It’s not what democracy looks like. It’s what corruption looks like,” Cavanaugh said, accusing the bill’s supporters of being “bought by the governor.”Cavanaugh, aided by liberal colleagues, had attempted to block the bill with an epic filibuster of nearly every other piece of legislation this year — which she has vowed to continue next session.On Friday, she shouted as she chanted along with protesters outside in the rotunda, “Trans people belong here! We need trans people! We love trans people!”“This does not end today for any of us,” Cavanaugh said Friday. “This is just the beginning.”She mentioned a national hotline run by the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ suicide prevention nonprofit, and urged those struggling as they watched the debate to call.“Nebraska is watching. The country is watching today, and a lot of people are in pain,” she said, later adding that she looked forward to seeing supporters of the bill voted out of office.“The people will remember today.”",

      "title": "Prince Harry, Meghan say they were chased by NYC paparazzi. Cab driver describes incident.",
      "text": "A group of “highly aggressive paparazzi” chased a vehicle transporting Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, after they attended a ceremony in New York City on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the couple said.The spokeswoman, who said Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, was also in the car, said the over two-hour chase was nearly “catastrophic.”A New York Police Department spokesperson said the presence of many photographers made the couple’s transport “challenging,” adding that they arrived at their destination safely without any collisions or injuries. A taxi driver who transported the couple for a part of their journey after they attended the event told The Washington Post in an interview that he would not call the incident a chase, adding that he felt safe during the ride.In an email to The Post, the spokeswoman said: “This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers.”“While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone’s safety,” the couple’s spokeswoman said.The New York Police Department said in a statement Wednesday that the department had “assisted the private security team protecting” Harry and Meghan the previous night.“There were numerous photographers that made their transport challenging,” NYPD spokesman Julian Phillips said in the statement. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests.”New York Mayor Eric Adams (D) said Wednesday morning that he was given a preliminary briefing on the matter and was informed that two New York City police officers “could have been injured.”Adams referred to the situation as a chase and called the incident “a bit reckless and irresponsible.” He appeared skeptical about whether there could have been a high-speed chase for two hours in the city but said that “a 10-minute chase is extremely dangerous in New York City.”Diana’s deadly crash echoes in Harry and Meghan’s paparazzi ‘car chase’Harry has frequently referenced how his mother, Princess Diana, was hounded by paparazzi, and he blames them for their role in her death. She died in a 1997 car crash in Paris while being chased by paparazzi. In his memoir “Spare,” Harry also detailed the relentless harassment of the press in his own life, especially of past girlfriends. The couple has previously expressed their concerns about being followed by paparazzi in their self-produced six-hour Netflix documentary. In a scene of the documentary, Harry and Meghan were shown being chauffeured in New York City and fearing that they were being followed by photographers.Video shared on social media showed the couple entering a black SUV after leaving the award ceremony at the Ziegfeld Ballroom on West 54th Street.In an interview Wednesday, taxi driver Sukhcharn Singh said he picked the couple up in New York later on Tuesday night and drove them for a brief period, during which it appeared they were pursued by other vehicles.Singh said he picked up Harry, Meghan, an older woman he didn’t recognize and a security guard in his yellow cab at about 11 p.m. outside the New York Police Department’s 19th Precinct on East 67th Street. In Singh’s account, the guard waved him down and asked: “Do you want a fare?”Singh, who goes by “Sunny,” said he drove the group a block and a half west to Park Avenue before heading south. The driver said they were pursued by two vehicles: a black Honda Accord and an older gray Honda CR-V.“They kept following us and were coming next to the car,” Singh said. “They took pictures as we stopped and were filming us.”Singh, 37, who moved to the United States from India as a child, said he got the impression from the group that they had been already pursued by paparazzi before entering his car. After a few minutes, Singh said, the security guard grew concerned about the photographers and asked him to return to the police station. The guard thought they were too exposed and didn’t want their location shared more widely, Singh said.He turned and headed north up Madison Avenue, driving them back to the pickup point. Singh estimated that the entire journey lasted 10 minutes.“I don’t think I would call it a chase,” Singh said of his period driving the couple. “I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn’t like a car chase in a movie. They were quiet and seemed scared but it’s New York — it’s safe.”Harry is suing the British government over his security arrangements when in the United Kingdom. Although he travels with his own security, he wants to pay for specially trained British police officers who have access to U.K. intelligence. The British government has resisted setting a precedent where individuals can pay for police.A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the incident.Meghan was in New York with Harry and Ragland to accept a Women of Vision award from the Ms. Foundation at the Ziegfeld Ballroom.Meghan briefly referred to the vitriol she says she faced in the British media in her acceptance speech:“The narrative on repeat that surrounded me allowed me to recognize that part of my greater value and purpose in life was to advocate for those who felt unheard, to stand up to injustice, and to be not afraid of saying what you know is true, and what is just, and what is right,” she said.The ceremony, held Tuesday night, was the first public event the Duchess of Sussex attended after the coronation of King Charles III on May 6, which Harry attended without her.The award honored Meghan’s “lifelong advocacy for women and girls,” including as a United Nations Women’s advocate for women’s political participation and leadership, according to the Ms. Foundation Women of Vision Awards website.Adam reported from London; Swaine, Chery and Salcedo reported from Washington.

      "title": "Advice | Carolyn Hax: A guest resents getting roped into post-dinner cleanup",
      "text": "Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: My local family (multiple households) and I rotate hosting duties for holidays and gatherings. Most of the time they are small affairs, with just six to eight of us.There seems to be a culture or expectation that even if we are guests at one of their homes, everyone pitches in to thoroughly clean up after the meals (in our nice clothes!). Everyone has their turn to host, so I am resentful when I am pulled into the group cleanup every single time. Can a guest not just be a guest? I feel annoyed that I cannot just sit there, lest it appear that I am being a selfish prima donna.Are my frustrations unreasonable? And is there a way to be a traditional guest again in these family circles?— Hostess With the Mostess ResentmentHostess With the Mostess Resentment: No, and apparently not. You want something different, so your frustration is reasonable, but your family has its methods. All evidence says you are alone in this preference, so you eat it unless you can persuade them to adopt your methods.That sounds like more work than a few dishes, but you’re welcome to try by suggesting it, maybe one household at a time.In your place, I’d surrender to the family custom — and direct your “elegant guest experience” efforts toward hosting a different crowd.Dear Carolyn: In the past week, my husband has misplaced his vaccination card, a tape measure and a twist-tie. Each time his immediate reaction was, “What did you do with my X?” I’ve tried to explain why this is such an offensive way to approach this, and he says he’s just “trying to find his stuff.” Please help me explain to him how utterly insulting that language is. He sees nothing wrong with it.— BlamedBlamed: “You blame me when you lose things” is not an elusive concept. When the obvious doesn’t get through to him, you have the option of making his phrasing so unproductive for him that his only choices are to suffer for it or abandon it.The right tone depends on you two. “Burned it,” “Flushed it,” “Fed it to the dog” might work, or bomb. “Are you saying you misplaced something?” is a redirect that might be familiar to parents of toddlers. “Nothing,” every single time for the rest of your lives together, might get through to him eventually.If he’s not otherwise entitled or obtuse, and if you know what he means and know he means no offense, then you can let a little poor phrasing go.And if he is otherwise entitled or obtuse, then ding, ding, ding.Readers’ thoughts:· “I hid it just so we could have this conversation for the millionth time.”· Listen, my husband blames me for letting it rain. I tell him it was his penalty for some other small idiotic thing. There’s not much use in answering with anything other than, “The same place I put your brain.”· My dad’s response to any of us six kids asking where something was: “I put it right back where you left it.” :)· My wife often decides to move something of mine to a better or more logical place, then I can’t find it. So when I misplace something, my first reaction is, “Did she move it?” However, I’ve found a better phrasing: “I can’t find my X; do you know where it is?” That gives her a chance to tell me where it is or to say no, without blaming. And sometimes the answer is, “It’s in your right hand.” (Yes, I’ve done that.)Answer this week’s reader question:Is it too late to report an inappropriate teacher?From the archive:When your friend’s boyfriend is rubbing your leg under the tableHe’d love to buy dinner, but all his money is invested in weedDemanding a paternity test without cause fails the good-husband testWe saved our marriage, but our friends remain skepticalThe dad who ran away from responsibility walks back into your lifeMore:Sign up for Carolyn’s email newsletter to get her column delivered to your inbox each morning.Carolyn has a Q&A with readers on Fridays.

      "title": "Zelensky makes dramatic G-7 visit as Biden mobilizes allies over China",
      "text": "HIROSHIMA, Japan — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived here Saturday for a dramatic last-minute visit to the Group of Seven summit of powerful democracies as President Biden sought to mobilize allies against a rising China’s growing political, military and economic power.Zelensky’s trip, which had become public only a day before, immediately overshadowed the leaders’ efforts to focus on issues beyond Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. But it underlined the summit’s broad theme of democracies standing up to autocracies, as Biden and his counterparts highlighted Moscow and Beijing as twin threats to a democratic world order.In their joint statement, the G-7 nations — which comprise Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union — sought to project unity on a range of global challenges. It was clear that supporting Ukraine and countering what they called China’s economic coercion remained the top priorities, and leaders specifically called out China for not playing an active role in ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.“We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine,” the leaders wrote in the communiqué. “We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the U.N. Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.”The joint statement, which also said the countries seek to have “constructive and stable relations with China,” came on the second day of a summit that has been largely oriented around Ukraine and its fight against Russia.Zelensky, continuing his flurry of international travel in recent days, arrived on a French government plane after visiting Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to speak at an Arab League meeting. His visit to Hiroshima, the site of nuclear destruction in World War II, came as he warned against modern-day nuclear threats by Russia.“Japan. G-7. Important meetings with partners and friends of Ukraine,” Zelensky wrote on Twitter after he landed in Hiroshima. “Security and enhanced cooperation for our victory. Peace will become closer today.”Biden is likely to meet with Zelensky, who won a significant victory when White House officials on Saturday confirmed they were going to allow allied nations to send F-16s to Ukraine and the United States would train Ukrainian pilots to fly the Western fighter jets. For months, the Ukrainian leader has been requesting the advanced aerial capabilities to bolster his country’s counteroffensive.“We have delivered what we promised,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters Saturday. “We have given Ukraine what it needs based on close consultations between our military and theirs. And now, we have turned to discussions about improving the Ukrainian air force as part of our long term commitment to Ukraine’s self-defense.”Sullivan described the training — which is a significant reversal for Biden, who earlier dismissed the need of the fighter jets — as a logical next phase in the war, after providing artillery, tanks, and other arms.Bowing to pressure, Biden relents on F-16s to UkraineBefore Zelensky’s arrival, the leaders spent much of the day focused on economic security, an all-but-explicit effort to push back on China’s economic influence.In response, Beijing lambasted the G-7 leaders in a forceful statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday evening, telling the G-7 countries to “focus on solving your own problems.”“The era when a few developed countries in the West willfully interfered in the internal affairs of other countries and manipulated global affairs is gone forever,” said the statement.Beijing turned the accusations of economic coercion against Washington for its use of sanctions, but did not explicitly mention the war in Ukraine, which China’s top leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly claimed to be in a position to mediate.The statement of unity among the leaders on China comes after French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to China last month on a three-day trip that drew the ire of allies around the world. In particular, Macron sparked controversy after telling reporters during the trip that Europe should not get “caught up in crises that are not ours” in reference to concerns about China’s activity around Taiwan.Sullivan, however, downplayed any concerns about fissures in the alliance over China. He said Biden and Macron had “a very good, constructive conversation” after the French president’s trip and maintained the communiqué’s language on China should come as no surprise.“The statement didn’t happen by accident or osmosis,” Sullivan told reporters Saturday. “It happened because we have had intensive consultations with our partners about the PRC and about how we approach that relationship in an effective and managed way.”U.S. officials said Biden expects to engage with Xi in the coming months, but they have yet to specify the timing of a meeting or phone call. The relationship between the United States and China seemed to be charting a new course after the two leaders met in November on the sidelines of the Group of 20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia and deputized their staff to work together on a range of issues.But those efforts stalled in February after a Chinese spy balloon was spotted floating across the country before being shot down by the United States off the Atlantic Coast, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded by canceling a trip to Beijing.The relationship remains tense, and analysts say the possibility of progress that came out of the Biden-Xi meeting six months ago has largely evaporated. Some worry over the increasingly tense rhetoric, and the expectations that positions will harden in a 2024 U.S. presidential campaign in which anti-China rhetoric is likely to escalate.Biden has offered very little public commentary during the trip, often seen only posing briefly for photos with leaders of other countries. When pressed about the lack of media access, a senior administration official said that much of that was determined by the host country, Japan.Biden is scheduled to hold a news conference on Sunday before returning back to Washington.The U.S. president had initially planned for a longer and more ambitious trip aimed at countering China, but he canceled stops in Papua New Guinea — where he was set to become the first U.S. president to travel to the country — and Australia to return to Washington to focus on talks with congressional leaders over raising the government’s debt limit and avoiding a potentially catastrophic default. That cancellation forced a flurry of efforts to limit the potential damage and any questioning of the U.S. commitments to the Indo-Pacific. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is now traveling on Sunday to Papua New Guinea, where he will meet with Prime Minister James Marape and sign a bilateral defense cooperation agreement and a bilateral maritime security agreement.Biden on Saturday night hosted a brief meeting with the Quad — a group that also includes leaders from Australia, Japan and India — instead of the more robust meeting that had been scheduled in Australia.Early in the meeting, Biden thanked the leaders for “accommodating the change in location.”As a part of an effort to counter the influence of China and Russia, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has sought to appeal to emerging and developing nations with deepening economic and security ties to Beijing and Moscow. China has invested heavily into its trade relations and infrastructure projects with South American and African countries and Russia’s military and political influence is growing rapidly throughout Africa.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered deep alarm in Japan, which saw it as a warning that a Chinese takeover of Taiwan could also be a reality. Japan is increasingly positioning itself as a regional leader in promoting a “free and open Indo-Pacific” united in shared values of sovereignty and opposition to changing the status quo by force. Kishida has repeatedly warned that Russia’s invasion could lead to ramifications in East Asia, saying, in a veiled reference to China: “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.”Japan has been forging deeper relations with Southeast Asian nations with economic and security ties to China, while also balancing its own economic interests with China, its biggest trading partner.Kishida and Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi have also been extending their outreach to Latin American and African countries in recent months. This weekend, Japan hopes to rally other world economic powers to demonstrate their commitment to supporting those nations as they face skyrocketing food and energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, climate change and infrastructure needs.To that end, Tokyo has invited Comoros, this year’s Africa Union chair, and Brazil to the G-7 summit. In addition, Japan has invited Quad partner countries India and Australia; the Cook Islands, the chair of the Pacific Island Forum; Indonesia, chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Vietnam; and South Korea.Global challenges “cannot be addressed by the G-7 alone, and must be addressed in cooperation with our partners in the international community, including the countries of the Global South,” Kishida said in a news conference Friday evening, using a terminology that groups together a broad swath of dozens of emerging and developing nations.“As G-7, we hope to demonstrate that we will make a positive and concrete contribution considering the needs of the respective countries through a people-centered approach,” Kishida added.Julia Mio Inuma contributed reporting.

      "title": "‘Betrayed and let down’: Syrians react as Assad is welcomed back to Arab fold",
      "text": "“The international community has failed us completely.”That was the assessment of Razan Saffour, 30, a British Syrian human rights activist who was among the many watching in disbelief and anger Friday as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was welcomed on an international stage — returning to the Arab League after an 11-year suspension.While the league has limited political power, Assad’s attendance at the regional summit was a major symbolic triumph for the former political pariah, whose forces have been accused of using chemical weapons and targeting hospitals and civilian areas during a bloody civil war that has lasted more than a decade and is still ongoing.Gulf nations were among those who had previously backed efforts to train and arm rebel factions seeking to overthrow Assad. However, Assad has since reclaimed control over much of the country with the help of Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, and some Arab countries have resumed diplomatic relations.For many Syrians affected by the conflict, Assad’s rehabilitation made them feel not only betrayed but as if their suffering from the civil war had been erased from the region’s memory completely.“Instead of holding Assad accountable for his heinous crimes … he is welcomed and even rewarded, as if the past 12 years of suffering and bloodshed never occurred,” said Wafa Ali Mustafa, 32.Mustafa, who fled Syria for Germany when her country was plunged into civil war after the Arab Spring uprisings, said her father, Ali Mustafa, a fruit seller, was forcibly disappeared by Assad’s regime in July 2013.The last time she and her three siblings saw their dad, he was being removed for their Damascus home, she said. “Normalizing relations is a betrayal to the victims and their families, including my own family. … Normalization can bring no peace. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman opened the summit acknowledging the “painful years of struggle” in Syria but added that he hoped the country’s rapprochement would bring greater stability to the region. Arab leaders have accused the United States of neglecting the region in favor of a focus on competition with China and Russia, and analysts say this has prompted many countries to hedge their bets.Many Syrians have described feeling forgotten, as the world’s attention was diverted to other crises, including the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Syria is no longer considered an American priority.“It bothers us as Syrians how the international community dealt with the war in Ukraine and the support that was provided to the Ukrainians … compared to the Syrian refugees,” said Haya Atassi, an organizer with a civil society group, referencing Russia’s involvement in both conflicts.Atassi says her family fled Homs after her brother was detained by government forces and schools closed down. She now lives between Beirut and Istanbul.Within Syria, protests took place across a number of opposition-held cities on Friday, as people filled the streets to proclaim their outrage at Assad’s participation at the summit.But some Syrians noted that his reintegration could provide some economic benefits for the nation, which is struggling with sanctions, the aftermath of the earthquake and the coronavirus pandemic.Pro-Assad social media users hailed Assad’s return as a victory, sharing images of him smiling and shaking hands with fellow leaders. One user on Twitter said he “stood tall” after Arab leaders had “bet on his downfall,” describing the about-turn from Arab states that funded factions to bring him down as a major victory.Despite Assad’s presence at the event, the Biden administration, like European allies, has vowed to maintain its policy of isolation and pressure against him — noting that the war has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and displaced half the country’s population.And Qatar, which has feuded with other Gulf states in recent years, said it disagreed with Syria’s re-inclusion in the Arab League but would not pose an “obstacle” to a move backed by regional powers. Reports highlighted that its Emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, left the summit ahead of Assad’s address.Arab embrace of Assad underscores divergence with U.S. over SyriaSaffour, who is now based in Doha, remained critical of both Arab and Western nations, saying: “They absolutely could have done so much more.”Her family from Aleppo and Homs have faced torture, bombardment, imprisonment and home destruction, she said, and relatives who survived now live as refugees in Turkey and Jordan or are contending with the aftermath of a February earthquake that shattered parts of northern Syria. Despite the world’s attention shifting away, the plight of Syrians still has an impact on the wider world, she added. “Syrians fled Assad … not just a war,” she said, and his political rehabilitation would ensure fewer Syrians would be willing to return home.Mustafa, who continues to advocate for the return of her father, argued that Assad’s international reintegration also sent a “perilous message” beyond Syria’s borders to other authoritarian leaders.“We are all vulnerable in a world that overlooks the gravity of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide,” she said.Syrian activists who spoke to The Post did not express any optimism that the political situation in Syria would improve, with Saffour noting that many Syrians had felt “betrayed and let down” for a very long time.However, some also described drawing on their shared experiences, as well as their memories of their loved ones, for strength.“Unfortunately, we received a lot of trauma and learned to depend only on ourselves, and this is what we will do,” Atassi said, adding that the war had bred resilience.Mustafa, meanwhile, said this of her father: “I cherish the lasting memory of our car rides together … venturing into the mountains for hours on end. Those moments held an indescribable beauty that I carry within me.”Ellen Francis contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Parkland mom hopes gruesome picture book on shootings jolts politicians",
      "text": "Patricia Oliver walked into Rep. Tony Cárdenas’s D.C. office last week and handed the California Democrat a new book she had written.The colorful illustrations on the cover looked like those of any other children’s book: A smiling boy walking off a school bus holding daisies. But the title, “Joaquin’s First School Shooting,” revealed the horror that awaited inside. The Os in “Shooting” are holes, representing the bullets that killed Oliver’s 17-year-old son, Joaquin, and 16 others in the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018.In his office, Cárdenas stared at the book in his hands for more than 10 seconds before retrieving tissues from his desk, video of the encounter shared with The Washington Post showed. He told Oliver through tears that he has a grandson named Joaquin.“You made me realize that I pray that Joaquin never has his first school shooting,” Cárdenas told Oliver.Since the Parkland shooting, Oliver and her husband, Manuel, have advocated for gun control, attending protests across the United States and founding Change the Ref, an advocacy group against gun violence. But as mass shootings continue, they created a children’s book in hopes of sharing their message in the simplest way.The short book describes, through detailed illustrations and rhymes, the experiences of Joaquin and his high school classmates after a gunman entered their school.“This is a specific way to raise to politicians and let them know in a very simple, childish way how important it is for them to take action,” Oliver, 56, told The Post. “It’s very powerful in the sense that the illustrations that you can see inside the book, the vocabulary that we use, the narrative that we use, it’s very simple and very hurtful. We believe that in this way, politicians will be touched by the need of doing something.”After the May 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Tex., creative directors at Burson Cohn & Wolfe, an international communications firm, developed the idea for a book about school shootings and asked the Olivers to collaborate.For Oliver, the decision was easy. Joaquin had told his parents he wanted to make a difference in the world through writing. He often awoke in the middle of the night to pen love poems to his girlfriend, Victoria Gonzalez, and jot down his thoughts on gun and immigration issues.The Olivers wanted readers to follow scenes from inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018. The book’s title is meant to convey that school shootings have become normal for kids — like their first steps, first word or first vacation.“This book is Joaquin’s story, but Joaquin’s story is everyone’s stories,” said Fede Garcia, Burson Cohn & Wolfe’s chief creative officer. “We all can be the face of the book.”On the day of the shooting, Joaquin brought daisies to school for his girlfriend. On the book cover, he’s wearing a shirt with an avocado print — to represent his love for guacamole — and a black beanie he often sported. While many children’s books include finger holes to turn the pages, the holes used to progress through “Joaquin’s First School Shooting” are located on children’s bodies to simulate bullet holes.“It’s the hardest book I’ve ever had to draw,” María Lavezzi, who has been an illustrator for 13 years, said in Spanish. “I cried and cried. It’s impossible for it not to spark something within you or at least make you question: What do we have to do to put an end to this violence?”The first page sets the book’s tone. It displays an illustration of Joaquin lying dead on the floor with a Valentine’s Day card and paint surrounding him. Joaquin was in his creative writing class, composing cards for his girlfriend and his friends, at the time of the shooting.“THE END OF THE DAY, WAS ALSO MY OWN. BLED OUT ON THE FLOOR, AND NEVER GOT HOME,” the page reads.The other illustrations feature more dead children and bullets shattering a window. One picture shows crying kids running through a hallway next to colorful lockers.Many words are printed in red to represent blood. The final illustration displays a protest in D.C. with the message: “WE MUST NOT FORGET, OR I’VE DIED IN VAIN! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, PLEASE … NEVER AGAIN!”This year, 21 school shootings have occurred in the United States, according to The Post’s data.“We went for the full impact because that’s what this situation needs,” said Garcia, the chief creative officer. “You need to sometimes grab politicians by the collar.”Within a week of shootings in Cleveland, Tex., Henryetta, Okla., and Atlanta, the book published May 5. The next day, a shooting occurred in an Allen, Tex., mall. The Olivers asked anyone who buys the book to send copies to politicians.Still, Oliver said looking at the book is painful.“But I immediately go back to normal,” Oliver said. “Because I have a duty in front of me, and I have to hold it very hard because that's what Joaquin wants from me.”Last week, Oliver shared the book in D.C. with about 25 politicians representing both parties. Early in the week, she met with Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), who stopped and cried while reading the first page.“Meeting with Joaquin’s parents just literally steels me to say, ‘We have to do something about this,’” Dean told The Post.On May 10, after Oliver met with Minority Whip Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.), Clark read the book on the House floor, directing her message to colleagues who she said “continue to prioritize guns over our children.”“Let us remember all of the victims and remember that this is a choice,” Clark said after her reading. “We have solutions. We can end gun violence in this country.”During Oliver’s meeting with Cárdenas, when the congressman told her that his grandson is also named Joaquin, Oliver apologized.“I’m very sorry that I have to do this,” Oliver told Cárdenas. “But I have to.”Placing a hand on Oliver’s shoulder, Cárdenas responded: “No, please don’t say that. You have to do this only because you care about everybody else.”Oliver left D.C. on Saturday, uncertain whether the book changed gun supporters’ opinions. On Monday, as she prepared for another week of advocacy, she received an alert on her phone: A gunman had killed three people in Farmington, N.M.“That’s why we have to keep working hard,” Oliver said. “Because this is killing us.”María Luisa Paúl contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Bob Baffert returns to the Triple Crown stage — and a reeling sport ",
      "text": "LOS ANGELES — In 2021, horse trainer Bob Baffert faced exile from his sport and national ridicule after his Kentucky Derby-winning horse, Medina Spirit, failed a post-race drug test. It was a scandal that put drug violations and dead horses in the headlines and Baffert in the crosshairs.In the midst of it, Baffert received a call from a Palm Beach area code. It was former president Donald Trump.Trump asked him what happened with Medina Spirit, Baffert later recalled. By then, Baffert had abandoned his earlier denials that the horse was given anything that would have set off a test. So he recited to Trump his new credo — that there were mere picograms of the substance in the horse’s system, the result of a salve to treat a rash.Baffert was accustomed to dealing with local horse reporters, he told Trump. But this was his first time under fire in the national media — and on “Saturday Night Live,” which had recently lampooned the trainer. He found a sympathetic audience in the ex-president, who mused that “people can be vicious” and counseled him on how to carry on: “You know, just nothing happened. Just go on with your job and keep your head up.”Baffert, famous for sparring with regulators, probably didn’t need advice on stubborn persistence. But in the two years since that conversation, he has indeed cut a Trump-like arc. And when he enters National Treasure at Saturday’s Preakness, Baffert, having served a patchwork of suspensions stemming from the Medina Spirit violation, will make his return to the Triple Crown stage arguably more powerful and more defiant than ever — even as his sport reels from another disastrous main event.The dark side of Bob Baffert’s reignBaffert has called himself the victim of “cancel culture,” lamenting what he describes as the unfair demise of his career while working to clear bans and suspensions in Kentucky, New York and elsewhere. He has mostly failed to win in court, but the campaign of attrition appears to have fatigued his loudest critics. And despite his claims of ruin, Baffert’s business has actually thrived thanks to his loyal base: thoroughbred owners who have given him a near-monopoly over elite racing in his home state of California. Now he arrives at Pimlico to a sport in existential crisis and divided by stalled efforts to enact federal regulation of the sport.In interviews, Baffert’s lead attorney, Clark Brewster, complained of unfair courts and regulators and claimed Baffert was scapegoated by a movement within thoroughbred racing to implement federal oversight of drug violations. “A lot of people were clamoring for more enforcement of horse racing from a medication standpoint, and after the Derby when the lab found 21 picograms in urine — eureka!” said Brewster, referring to the amount of betamethasone detected in Medina Spirit’s sample.“Baffert was just iconic enough … that everyone wants to take a shot, but no one wants to write the article that says: ‘You know what? This was really overdone,’ ” Brewster added.The attorney initially raised the prospect of a reporter visiting Baffert at his barn near San Diego before the trainer headed to Maryland for the Preakness. But he later said Baffert would be unavailable for a meeting or phone interview because the trainer was “fully tuned to the details and final prep for the Pimlico horses.”When Medina Spirit tested positive for betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory, it was Baffert’s fifth positive drug test in 13 months and 30th over four decades in racing. He blamed a familiar culprit: “the science.”“That’s the only thing on this sport — you can follow the rules and still get in trouble because they don’t have the science,” Baffert later testified.After the Derby, Baffert went on a press tour blaming that science, as well as a conspiracy against him, while insisting he had never given the horse betamethasone or any other ointment. But his longtime veterinarian had documented his use of Otomax, a medication containing betamethasone, on the horse.Baffert’s shifting stories contributed to the decision to ban him, Churchill Downs Racetrack President Mike Anderson later testified. “It just seemed like it was just a lack of understanding of what his horse was being administered race day or the day before race day,” Anderson said.Baffert’s suspensions are over; he’s eligible to enter a horse at New York’s Belmont Stakes in June to round out the Triple Crown series. But his fight isn’t over, including an ongoing lawsuit against Churchill Downs and an appeal to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.In legal filings, Baffert has been dire about the effects of the punishments on his business. He claimed in affidavits that the two-year ban from the Derby, in which two of Baffert’s horses started their path to Triple Crowns, “will effectively put me out of business.”But that was certainly not so in California, where he has long wielded clout in the industry. Citizens there urged racing regulators to  levy a lengthy suspension against Baffert. “Mr. Bob Baffert and the Kentucky Derby are not on the agenda,” one commissioner said, and the industry stuck by him. That included, notably, Medina Spirit’s owner, Amr Zedan. The Saudi billionaire testified in Baffert’s defense, calling Baffert’s barn “basically the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Four Seasons, if you will, of horses.” And he was among the owners of horses in a race at Santa Anita Park near Los Angeles in February that fully displayed Baffert’s dominance: 14 of the 16 horses that were nominated and all four of the horses that ended up racing were Baffert trainees. Baffert earned roughly $9.7 million in North American races for his owners in 2022, a modest year by his standards but only $500,000 less than he earned in 2019, the last pre-pandemic year before the scandal.While Baffert dominated his competition in California, his lawyers attempted to refashion his legacy in court. In court filings, his attorneys tallied only “fully adjudicated medication positives” and only those since 2005 — of which by their count there were nine, not 30. They reduced even more drastically the death toll attributed to him. The Washington Post found in 2021 that 74 horses had died in Baffert’s care in California and that his horses have the highest rate of deaths per start among top trainers in the state. In court filings, however, Baffert’s team cited an obscure database tracking only some deaths in recent years and operated by a Kentucky nonprofit to peg the Baffert death toll at five.Baffert’s actual toll has increased by at least three since his last Derby, records show. Medina Spirit died of a heart attack in December 2021. Then, last July, a 2-year-old horse called Rapacious was euthanized after falling on its back during a workout. And in January, Alsalam, a 3-year-old owned by Zedan, was euthanized following a workout. Veterinary notes describing Alsalam’s death read: “Went wrong pulled up, vanned off.”No necropsy was performed. Amanda Drummond, an official at the California Horse Racing Board, said that was because Alsalam died at an equine hospital. The board is “presently advancing a regulation” that would require necropsies in those cases, Drummond said.Brewster called The Post’s count “false” and said it was unfair to monitor all deaths in Baffert’s care. In many cases, he said, “it doesn’t have anything to do with training — it has to do with natural events that occur with all animals that can cause an injury or death.”Shortly before he left office, Trump signed an act resulting in the creation of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, a regulatory body to oversee drug rules in the sport.But its anti-doping efforts have stalled, primarily because of legal challenges by the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, an industry group that includes racehorse owners and trainers. HISA is now slated to go into effect Monday, two days after the Preakness.HISA CEO Lisa Lazarus said in an interview Thursday that she is “very confident” the authority will not be delayed further by last-minute legal efforts. Lazarus said HISA will start every trainer with a clean slate in terms of tracking — and punishing — drug violations.“I would say to any trainer who has proclaimed their innocence and feels like they were wrongly treated by the system … now’s an opportunity to show that you’re doing things the right way,” Lazarus said.Arthur Hancock III, a Kentucky breeder, is among those horsemen who helped push for the bill. In the wake of the deaths at the Derby, he expressed pessimism about whether the sport can be finally cleaned up. Churchill Downs suspended a trainer of two of the horses indefinitely and in a statement said the deaths, though “anomalies,” were “unacceptable.”Hancock said the opinion among some horsemen is that “they’re cheating more than ever now” amid a vacuum of enforcement. “Status quo, business as usual — I mean, that’s what it looks like to me,” Hancock said.Monty Roberts, a retired horse trainer who has sparred with Baffert for years, expressed hope that the sport will be run more strictly under the new authority. In that case, he said, he welcomed Baffert’s return.“I would love it if he could just compete with everybody on a clean basis,” Roberts said. “Because then you would see how good he is. The way it is now, he wins a race and you say, ‘Oh, I wonder what that horse is on.’ ”",

      "text": "President Biden is likely to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Japan for the Group of Seven summit this weekend, according to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. While he did not have an official announcement, Sullivan said Biden “looks forward to the opportunity to be able to sit down face to face with President Zelensky.”The Ukrainian leader landed in Hiroshima airport on a French plane on Saturday. He is attending the G-7 meeting in person this weekend, though his precise plans remain unclear.Zelensky arrives boosted by Washington’s decision not to block allies from responding to Kyiv’s appeals for U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets. The United States will also support the joint effort to provide training to Ukrainian pilots, Sullivan said.Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.Ukrainians, crossing Dnieper River, test Russian lines on southern front: Intrigue about where Ukraine’s counterattack will occur has focused on the Zaporizhzhia region, or in the east around the embattled city of Bakhmut, Isabelle Khurshudyan and Kamila Hrabchuk report from Ukraine’s southern Kherson region.“Those scenarios are more likely, but Ukrainians also have been quietly testing their ability to push across the Dnieper and training units in how to conduct a possible river landing,” they write.Mikhail Klimentov, Matt Viser, Tyler Pager, Natalia Abbakumova and David L.

      "title": "Ukrainians, crossing Dnieper River, test Russian lines on southern front",
      "text": "KHERSON, Ukraine — Every night in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, soldiers file into small dinghies to cross the Dnieper River and bring the battle closer to their Russian enemy.The sprawling waterway, with Russian and Ukrainian forces posted on opposite banks, is the war’s most immovable front, a barrier to transporting troops and supplies. But as Kyiv readies a highly-anticipated counteroffensive, an attack on the river’s east bank might be the one place where the Russians could be caught by surprise.“In the history of war and military art, there are many examples of crossing a water barrier — a river landing or a sea landing,” Brig. Gen. Mykhaylo Drapatyy, Ukraine’s commander of the operational group of Kherson troops, said. “Certain conditions are being created so that the Dnieper River barrier will not only hinder us but also help us to accomplish our task. If the conditions are right, we will move forward.”Intrigue about where Ukraine’s counterattack will take place in the coming weeks has focused on the Zaporizhzhia region, where Kyiv’s forces conducting an overland assault would likely try to expel the Russian occupiers from the city of Melitopol, and break the so-called land bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea, where Russia has several strategic military bases.Ukraine might also continue counterattacking in the east, where it has recently made gains around the long-beleaguered city of Bakhmut.Those scenarios are more likely, but Ukrainians also have been quietly testing their ability to push across the Dnieper and training units in how to conduct a possible river landing. Ukraine used the tactic of surprise to its advantage in a sweeping, fast counteroffensive last fall, which liberated nearly the entire northeast Kharkiv region within a week. Like in the Kherson region now, the Russians left the weakest grouping of forces in Kharkiv at the time, expecting the Ukrainians to attack somewhere else.A cross-river attack could be just as unexpected and also yield big territorial gains. There are approximately 40,000 Russian troops in the Kherson region on the river’s east bank, Drapatyy said. And regaining control there would similarly break the land corridor and put Ukrainian forces near the Crimean border — a goal for Kyiv, which has vowed to reclaim the peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014.Ukrainian Special Operations forces have already crossed over to the east side of the river for raids along the shore, Drapatyy said, but the Ukrainians do not have any stable posts there yet. The Russian positions are some three miles inland from the riverbank, and the Ukrainians would need to push them back at least another six miles to get the city of Kherson, located on the west side and under the control of Ukrainian forces, out of artillery range.“We are trying not only to show our presence but also to make the enemy nervous by active actions in those areas,” Drapatyy said.Russian forces retreated from the west bank of the Dnieper River in November, when Ukrainian forces got within strike range of the bridge crossings, threatening to trap the occupying troops who would have no way of getting to their strongholds on the other side. The Russians opted to pull back their forces to the east bank and blow up any bridges behind them. That left the Ukrainians without an obvious way across to continue the assault.Now, artillery shells and drones loaded with explosives fly across the river daily, the battle settling into one of distance while Ukrainian assault units train twice per week for operations to cross the Dnieper both by boat and using a pontoon-bridge, Drapatyy said. Ukraine also has started constructing barges that could be used to transport heavy weaponry across the river.“Maybe I’m an optimist, but I do believe in the time that will come when we need to set up logistics,” Drapatyy said. “We will not be able to solve the issue with just one or two or three pontoon bridges, so we will use everything we can, including army aviation, and we are working on this issue and preparing for it.”Zelensky toured Europe seeking new weapons. Here’s what he came home with.Challenges remain: The Ukrainians don’t yet have a bridgehead, and any attempt at one would immediately be targeted by Russian artillery.“And the Russians mined everything on the other side,” said Col. Roman Kostenko, a member of Ukraine’s national parliament who is part of a unit that works with Special Operations Forces. “The water is mined, and the shore is mined.”“You’re going to get killed right away trying to cross,” Kostenko said. “There would need to be a logistical reason for it all. Some 20 or 30 people could quietly take some piece of territory that is 100 meters, but then artillery will bury them within 15 minutes. If you’re going to do it, then you need to do it for something — a bridgehead and then to create a logistics chain for an accumulation of troops.”But the Ukrainians’ first priority is reclaiming the islands between the riverbanks, where the main fight is taking place now, because it could give Kyiv’s forces a closer launch point to cross to the Dnieper’s left coast. Drapatyy said they are “90 percent” under Ukrainian control, “if not with our physical presence, then under visual and fire control.”“In the future, this may be one of the areas for a bridgehead where we will accumulate forces,” he said. “And perhaps if we divert attention to another front, we will be successful.”On Velykyi Potomkin, the largest of the islands and where the river splits south of Kherson city, Russian forces are on the southern edges while Ukrainians are posted on the northern side. Now-abandoned vacation cottages on the shore have wooden piers. Soldiers approaching in dinghies cut the motor as they get closer, quietly docking and then scrambling inside.“You move quickly until the enemy drone sees you or until the mortar fire kills you,” said Andrii, the commander of a unit that has been part of the battles on Velykyi Potomkin. The Post agreed to identify Andrii only by his first name because he was not authorized to speak about his operations.“You run to the houses,” Andrii said. “If they start shooting, you run to the next one.”Andrii said he “thought we were going to die” the first time he and his men got into their boats and crossed the river last winter. The Ukrainians got lucky, he said, and landed on a spot of the island where the Russians weren’t at the time. When the Russians finally got there, the Ukrainians ambushed them — and then the reinforcements, too.“From that small patch, where we first established ourselves, we built up little by little,” he said. “It’s been at least three months, and we’re making progress.”The terrain through the middle of the island is impassable, Andrii said, so soldiers move along the shore, from house to house. The Russians rarely leave their bases, but the Ukrainians have been on the attack recently.Russian scientists, experts in hypersonic technology, arrested for treason“Until you enter the house, you don’t know if they’re in there,” he said. “You might walk in and a machine gun is already pointed at you.”Russian military bloggers late last month started raising alarm about Ukrainian forces creeping up on the shore of the Dnieper’s left bank. Small commercial drones regularly drop explosives, spikes and mines on the 2 miles of road between where the Antonovsky Bridge used to meet the left bank and where the Oleshky bridge begins. The goal is to make the road unusable for vehicles especially — another way of pushing the Russians back from the shoreline because they wouldn’t be able to evacuate any dead or wounded or resupply forces at the river’s edge.Drapatyy has noticed the Russians recently fortifying their deeper defenses, planting more mines and increasing the frequency of reconnaissance drones they sent flying over to the right side. He said he can hear panic when he listens to their intercepted conversations.“They are worried,” he said, “that we are preparing for active actions in our direction. All the more reason why we have no right not to prepare.”Portraits of Ukraine: Every Ukrainian’s life has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion one year ago — in ways both big and small. They have learned to survive and support each other under extreme circumstances, in bomb shelters and hospitals, destroyed apartment complexes and ruined marketplaces. Scroll through portraits of Ukrainians reflecting on a year of loss, resilience and fear.Battle of attrition: Over the past year, the war has morphed from a multi-front invasion that included Kyiv in the north to a conflict of attrition largely concentrated along an expanse of territory in the east and south. Follow the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces and take a look at where the fighting has been concentrated.A year of living apart: Russia’s invasion, coupled with Ukraine’s martial law preventing fighting-age men from leaving the country, has forced agonizing decisions for millions of Ukrainian families about how to balance safety, duty and love, with once-intertwined lives having become unrecognizable. Here’s what a train station full of goodbyes looked like last year.Deepening global divides: President Biden has trumpeted the reinvigorated Western alliance forged during the war as a “global coalition,” but a closer look suggests the world is far from united on issues raised by the Ukraine war. Evidence abounds that the effort to isolate Putin has failed and that sanctions haven’t stopped Russia, thanks to its oil and gas exports.",

      "title": "With an app-fueled ownership structure, Mage is the people’s horse",
      "text": "BALTIMORE — The Pimlico Race Course winner’s circle is a grassy, hedge-lined ring near the finish line where, on the third Saturday of each May, the new Preakness champion, draped in a blanket of black-eyed Susans, is paraded past  TV cameras and VIPs to be met by his jubilant connections. Typically the milieu of white-haired owners and rosy-cheeked grandchildren, the circle also hosts the occasional dignitary, from princes of Saudi Arabia to sitting governors of Maryland to — 50 years ago this week — Secretariat himself.But if a certain chestnut colt should win the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, thus securing the second leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown, the scene in the winner’s circle could be unlike any in the century-and-a-half history of this race — with the gathering of millionaires and grizzled horsemen likely to be infiltrated by dozens of raucous, 30-something newbies whose ownership micro-shares in the horse known as Mage were obtained for as little $50.In other words, it would be not at all unlike the scene that unfolded two weeks earlier at Churchill Downs — where Mage, a lightly raced 15-1 shot with a charming backstory and an unusual ownership structure, outran 17 rivals to win the Kentucky Derby. In the chaos of the winner’s circle, when they finally lined up everyone who owned a piece of Mage, the photographers shooting the traditional victory photo may have had to switch to a wider lens.Mage wins Kentucky Derby after run-up rife with scratches and tragedy“It looked like the cover of ‘Sgt. Pepper’s,’ ” joked Ramiro Restrepo, one of Mage’s controlling owners, speaking of the resulting photo, with its teeming horde of cocktail-toting, ballcap-wearing investor bros, who numbered more than 100. (In reality, the collage on the front of the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” contains far fewer faces.)It is true, however, that Mage — a true champion of the people, in the most literal sense possible — is the closest thing horse racing has to a rock star at the moment and the best shot at a redemptive storyline for a beleaguered sport that sometimes appears to be on the verge of collapsing under the weight of equine deaths and doping scandals. Such as the ones that occurred in the run-up and aftermath of the Derby.“That’s why I say Mage was like a gift from above,” said Brian Doxtator, co-founder and CEO of Commonwealth Racing, the “fractional investment platform” that, along with 391 micro-investors who bought in via its app, owns 25 percent of Mage. “The timing of it for our business, our customers and for horse racing couldn’t be better. And horse racing did need this. … I do think we’re putting a slightly different lens over horse racing. And it is at a critical juncture for the industry at this moment. There is a ragtag, underdog charm with almost all of Mage’s human connections: His jockey, Javier Castellano, snapped a career 0-for-15 Derby skid with the win. His trainer and co-owner, Gustavo Delgado Sr., is a legendary horseman in his native Venezuela, where he won that country’s version of the Triple Crown four times, but had never finished better than 12th in two previous tries in the Derby. Co-owner Restrepo is a gregarious, fifth-generation horseman with Colombian roots and a knack for blowing past his budget.“One heck of a melting pot,” Restrepo said of Mage’s collective connections following the Derby win.It was only a year ago this week that Restrepo and Gustavo Delgado Jr. — the trainer’s son and assistant — first laid eyes on Mage at an auction of 2-year-olds that took place at the Timonium Fairgrounds, just a few miles up Interstate 83 from Pimlico. Told by Delgado Sr. not to exceed the budget of $100,000, Restrepo and Delgado Jr. decided they could probably go to $200,000 if they needed to — then stayed in the bidding for the horse they desperately wanted until they finally got him for $290,000.That horse, from the first crop sired by 2018 Kentucky Derby runner-up Good Magic, out of the Big Brown mare Puca, was Mage. Though the purchase barely caused a ripple across the industry at the time — 25 horses fetched higher prices at that auction, including one, Hejazi, that went for $3.55 million — it would change the course of history.“It was intuition. We had to have him,” Delgado Jr. said. “I told Ramiro, we’re going to go after him, and then we’ll figure out where the money was going to come from.”That budgetary overreach — and the financial scrambling that followed — is what led the cash-strapped new owners of Mage, several weeks later, to Commonwealth, a 2019 start-up in the fractional investing space that had had a massive breakthrough in 2022, when its horse Country Grammer won the $12 million Dubai World Cup.Greenberg: Odds, post positions and analysis for the 2023 Preakness StakesOnce Doxtator and Commonwealth partner Chase Chamberlin agreed to go in on a quarter of the horse — plus their share of two years of annual training expenses — it was time to offer him to the app’s users, who numbered around 6,500 at the time. Shares were $50 each, and while shareholders could profit from both race earnings and eventually stud fees, anyone who knows anything about horse racing understands many more investments turn into duds than turn into Kentucky Derby winners.But Commonwealth sees its mission less as a microinvesting tool than as a community-builder. It sells an experience as much as it does a racehorse. Because its investors had owner status, they could visit the paddock before races and — should everything break just right — the winner’s circle afterward.“People focus on the financials, but what we’re actually trying to do is build a community of sports fan — I call them the ‘big day out’ crowd,” Doxtator said. “These are people that invite five of their friends to the track or to a golf tournament. Or these are music festival-goers. These are people who are accustomed to [bringing along] four or five of their friends. They don’t just go do it themselves. … We get $50 shareholders in the paddock all the time. I hear them say all the time, ‘You can’t do anything like this for 50 bucks.’ When Mage’s offering went live on the Commonwealth app in January, it took just 48 hours for shares to sell out. Three hundred ninety-one users bought in, with investments ranging from $50 to $20,000. More than 100 of those Commonwealth investors traveled to the Derby, with seats scattered all around Churchill Downs.“We told them going in, ‘We can’t make any guarantees [about access].’ First of all, this was our first Kentucky Derby, too,” Doxtator said. “We didn’t know how it was going to work.”In the wild aftermath of Mage’s improbable win, the Commonwealth crowd — distinguished by white “Mage” caps — converged upon the winner’s circle, initially overwhelming the security personnel. “There’s all these people pouring in,” Doxtator recalled. “I think the [security guards] were finally like, ‘Okay, if they have the hat on, we’ll let them in.’ ”A bunch of the delirious Commonwealth users — some of whom, and this simply can’t be reiterated enough times, bought in for just 50 measly bucks — lingered in the winner’s circle long enough to take turns kissing the trophy. Thanks in large part to a brief mention on NBC’s telecast of the Derby, Commonwealth saw more than 6,000 new users sign up in the first 48 hours afterward. Doxtator, 40, and Chamberlin, 32 — childhood friends from Kalamazoo, Mich. — fielded so many media inquiries, they enlisted another friend to help them out as a PR contact. Among the many industry calls they fielded were some from agents from the worlds of golf and tennis: In the coming months, Commonwealth plans to branch into those sports, with PGA Tour rookies Joey Vrzich and Cooper Dossey having already signed on.Commonwealth wasn’t the first company to offer micro-shares of a racehorse or even the first to win the Kentucky Derby; MyRacehorse had a piece of 2020 champion Authentic. But perhaps because of their youth and their backgrounds in tech start-ups, Doxtator and Chamberlin have found a foothold with a younger, more tech-savvy crowd; Doxtator said the average age of a Commonwealth user is 36, decades younger than the average thoroughbred owner, and a new user can go from downloading the app to buying a share in about 90 seconds.And while the minimum cost for a share of Authentic through MyRacehorse was $206, Commonwealth made sure to aim lower with Mage.“We’re trying to democratize this sport,” Doxtator said.Across the embattled industry, people have taken notice. Dalmore Group, the broker-dealer through which Commonwealth offers its investments, said in a statement that Mage’s Derby win “sent ripples through the horse racing community.”“This democratization of the sport has the potential to make horse racing more inclusive,” Dalmore said. “Mage’s victory in the Kentucky Derby is a testament to the power of fractional ownership and its potential to revolutionize the horse racing industry. … The sport of kings is no longer reserved for just a privileged few.”Meanwhile, for the 391 Commonwealth users who bought in to Mage, the Derby win resulted in a $95 payout for each $50 they invested — on top of their initial investment — which is still far less than what that same $50 would have gotten them at the betting window, where a $2 win bet returned $32.42. But based on the stallion offers Commonwealth is already fielding for Mage once his racing career is over, Doxtator estimates those $50 shares will eventually be worth at least $500 each.And anyway, the money is only a small part of the draw. Watching a horse — your horse — charge to the finish line in front of the pack, then making your way down to the winner’s circle to celebrate another jewel in the Triple Crown and kiss another trophy? Whether you’re in for a gazillion or just 50 bucks — such a thing would be priceless.",

      "title": "10 ways to get a nicer home with just $20",
      "text": "I’ve always hated flipping on a bright light first thing in the morning. Until recently, I assumed there was nothing to be done about this — at least not without buying a new bedside lamp or paying an electrician. Then I read that I could simply get a cheap dimmer that attaches to any old lamp. Now, when I wake up, I slide it to the lowest possible brightness and sip coffee in groggy peace. For $20, I significantly improved how I start each day.My dimmer-DIY was a lightbulb moment (bad pun intended). It got me thinking of all the other easy fixes that could probably make our apartment more comfortable or attractive. Home decor and DIY experts confirmed I was right: Here are 10 ways to upgrade your space for $20 or less.As I learned with the table lamp dimmer, lighting can seriously affect your mood. Adding it to my lamp was simple: I just plugged it into the wall outlet, then plugged my lamp into it, like you would with an extension cord.Or, try trading a regular bulb for a smart lightbulb, whose brightness and temperature you control through your phone (no special smart home system required). Monica Benavidez, the interior stylist behind DIY blog Monica Wants It, recommends the kind by Bulbrite which cost about $18 each (or less if you buy a pack of several). “If I’m crafting, I want the brightest and coolest setting, but when I’m working on my blog in the evenings I prefer warm, dim light,” she says.You might not realize it, but switch plates (the covers over light switches and outlets) can visually clutter up a wall. To streamline them, Lauren Comer, of home decor blog Pinch Plate Party, suggests swapping in the kind that conceal the screws, which you can find for under $5 each. With a bigger budget, you could also choose a color that better matches the room — for instance, replacing white with brass.Many large museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian, include downloadable public domain art on their websites that’s free to anyone. Just be sure to download a high-resolution version so it won’t be blurry when printed.“Once I find art I like, I print posters using a one-hour photo service to create my own art for super cheap,” says Benavidez, who has printed 16-by-20-inch images for as little as $8. “Then, I use thrifted frames to create a gallery wall. It’s a great way to get high-end looking art.”Extra large art can get expensive, but you can make your own using little more than wood furring strips (long, flat pieces that cost a couple dollars apiece at hardware stores), and — of all things — a shower curtain.To start, use four one-by-three-inch furring strips to build a frame, says Cara Newhart, an interior designer and host of the Make Space podcast. She suggests using a miter box to make it easier to cut the strips in a straight line (or try asking an employee at a hardware store to cut them for you). From there, you can attach them together using staples and a $5 bottle of wood glue. Next, stretch the shower curtain over the frame and staple the edges.To wrangle keys, mail and other household ephemera, interior designer Cassandra LaValle suggests buying decorative boxes or trays. Visual clutter can contribute to stress, but having nice places for everyday items helps keep the chaos at bay. While small storage solutions, sometimes called “trinket dishes,” are cheap at large retailers, you can also find unique pieces at thrift stores. Vintage candy bowls, for instance, make elegant holding places for jewelry and toiletries such as cotton balls or Q-tips.Research shows that houseplants can make us feel happier and more peaceful in our homes. Though large or rare plants tend to get pricey, more common types — such as pothos and snake plants — can easily be found for under $20. Research care instructions in advance to choose a variety that will thrive in your space.Or maybe you have a plant that just needs a snazzier home. Retailers such as Target and Ikea have a host of stylish planter options for under $20.Home improvement stores such as Home Depot and Lowe’s often sell “mistint” paint at a steep discount. In many cases, these paints have been returned by customers who realized they’d chosen the wrong color.“It’s kind of a crap shoot in terms of what will be available, but they’re definitely worth checking out,” says Benavidez, who has used this strategy to buy a gallon of paint for $15.Depending on the cost, you might be able to coat a small accent wall for under $20 (use a paint calculator to estimate how much you’ll need). You could also paint a door or trimwork, or an old piece of furniture.While cabinet knobs and handles range widely in price, Benavidez says you can update your existing hardware using only spray paint.She transformed the chrome drawer pulls in her bathroom with gold paint that she usually finds at Walmart or Home Depot for $6 to $8. Before painting, she sprayed all the chrome parts with heavy-duty primer, letting them dry by a fan for 20 minutes. Then she applied a light coat of gold, let it dry, and repeated the process a few more times.“That’s a quick afternoon project that can make a big impact,” she says. “It still looks great five years later.”To add a jolt of pattern to a relatively small surface area, such as an accent wall or the inside of a bookshelf, try fabric as a less expensive alternative to wallpaper.Lifestyle blogger Amber Oliver used a floral print she found at JOANN Fabric and Crafts for a wall in her former home office. To attach the material, she sprayed Elmer’s Craftbond Spray Adhesive directly onto the wall, then had a friend help her carefully spread the fabric over it. In a few spots, Oliver added staples to keep edges in place, but she says one benefit of such a busy print is that it hides imperfections.Another perk of choosing fabric over wallpaper: It’s easier to remove. Oliver says her accent wall held up for several years before she moved, at which point she peeled the fabric off without leaving a mark. Though this specific project cost about $40, she has used the method on the interior of a bookshelf for less than $20. And, of course, the cost of fabric varies widely, so you can decide how much or how little you want to spend.DIY blogger Carrie Waller loved the vintage end table she’d found secondhand, but not its sponge-painted top, so she covered it with about $5 worth of peel-and-stick wallpaper.She sanded down the painted surface, then cleaned it with tack cloth and a dry towel. (If your tabletop is smooth already, you could possibly skip these steps.) She applied the wallpaper, using a wallpaper smoothing tool to get rid of air bubbles and a handled razor blade to trim edges. She says it took only about 30 minutes to transform the table.Annie Midori Atherton is a writer in Seattle who covers culture, lifestyle, business and parenting.The Home You Own is here to help you make sense of the home you live in.DIYs you can actually do yourself: Don’t be intimidated by those home projects.

      "title": "Four children are missing after a plane crash in Colombia. Here’s what we know.",
      "text": "Earlier this week, Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared on Twitter what seemed like the uplifting afterword to a grim story: Four children who had gone missing in the jungle following a plane crash had been found alive, he wrote, describing the news as “a joy for the country.”But just one day later, on Thursday, Petro retracted his tweet, saying he could not confirm the information he had shared earlier.The fate of the children remains unknown.Petro’s whiplash reversal drew attention to the story of the children, four siblings who are 13, 9, 4 and 11 months old. On May 1, the small plane they were traveling in disappeared from radars, according to authorities. The bodies of their mother and two other people were later found by authorities at the site of the crash.More than 100 members of the military, as well as three rescue dogs, have been involved in the search for survivors, the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement Wednesday, adding that Indigenous communities have also taken part in the rescue effort.The first positive sign came Wednesday, when the aviation authority announced that rescuers had discovered a makeshift shelter created from sticks and branches, as well as a pair of scissors and some hairbands. Footprints, apparently made by children, were reportedly found as well.#OperaciónEsperanza pic.twitter.com/N9YgDrxecWJust hours later, the country’s child-protection agency, the Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF), released a statement on Twitter saying it had received information “confirming contact” with the four children, who were reportedly found “alive and in also good health.”The agency informed the president, the statement said, but added that “military forces have not yet been able to officially establish contact, due to the difficult weather conditions and the difficult terrain.” These conditions had also posed a challenge to the military as it was conducting its search. On Friday, 50 more soldiers were dispatched to aid in the search.Since those initial reports, however, the government and the military have been unable to make direct contact with the children, leading to confusion about their whereabouts and well-being.The director of the ICBF, Astrid Caceres, told local media that the agency had heard from two reliable sources that the children had been found. However, Caceres said she was waiting to see photos of the children to serve as conclusive proof or their survival.Petro apologized Thursday for contributing to the confusion. “I regret what happened,” he tweeted. “At this time there is no greater priority than moving forward with the search until [the children] are found.”",

      "text": "The Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes played the sixth-longest game in NHL history Thursday night, a 3-2 Panthers win in four overtimes that took 139 minutes 47 seconds of ice time to complete and ended at 1:54 a.m. Eastern.In honor of the latest Stanley Cup playoff marathon, which gave the Panthers a 1-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference finals, here’s a look at the longest games in NHL history.Matthew Tkachuk ends the sixth-longest game in NHL history1936 Stanley Cup semifinalsWe have to go back 87 years for the longest game in NHL history, which mercifully ended when Detroit’s Mud Bruneteau scored at 16:30 of the sixth overtime. With 116:30 of overtime, the teams nearly played the equivalent of three full games, beginning on March 24 and ending around 2:30 a.m. on March 25. According to the NHL, Red Wings goalie Normie Smith lost 12 pounds of body weight during the game as he unofficially made 92 saves (shots were not yet an official NHL statistic).Keep in mind that Zamboni ice-resurfacing machines were not used by NHL teams until the mid-1950s, so the rink at Montreal Forum must have been a disaster as the game wore on.1933 Stanley Cup semifinalsThree years earlier, the deciding game of a best-of-five series between Toronto and Boston lasted so long that the morning papers began to be sold at Maple Leaf Gardens.After a goal by the Bruins’ Alex Smith was disallowed by an offside call in the third overtime, and after another scoreless 20 minutes in the fourth, the teams’ general managers decided that the game would be decided by a coin flip. After all, the ice was extremely chopped up and the Maple Leafs were playing with numerous injured players. But players from both teams protested the decision and the game staggered on until Toronto forward Ken Doraty — all 135 pounds of him — beat Boston goalie Tiny Thompson at 4:46 of the sixth overtime and 164:46 of total play.“We wanted to play until somebody won legitimately,” Thompson said. “It didn’t matter to us if it took all night, and it nearly did.”2000 Eastern Conference semifinalsThe longest modern-day NHL game (92:01) — which took place two days after a single-overtime Game 3 — ended in the fifth extra period when Philadelphia’s Keith Primeau lumbered up the ice, cut inside to shake Pittsburgh defenseman Darius Kasparaitis and put one past Penguins goalie Ron Tugnutt on the short side.Flyers center Daymond Langkow nearly ended the game just 31 seconds into the first overtime, but his shot hit the crossbar. As the overtimes piled up, things started to get a little desperate as the players tried to keep up their energy between periods.“Usually on the road the team orders pizza for the locker room,” Primeau said. “There’s pizza for the guys, power gels, power bars, they were really popular. The trunk of those was gone, the pizza was gone. Trainers are going up to concession stands to see if there’s anything there. [The] coaches’ popcorn was eaten.”Said referee Rob Shick: “We had the standby ref order pizza after I think it was the second or third [overtime] because we didn’t even know if we could get anything to eat after the game. In those days the teams didn’t really supply us with anything to eat. Back then we got nothing. We were lucky to get a couple rolls of tape. The problem is we had one of our standbys who’s probably the guy with the biggest appetite on our staff, and he ate three-quarters of our pizza.”2020 Eastern Conference first roundThe 2020 playoffs were played under quarantine conditions in empty arenas because of the coronavirus pandemic, and its very first game was this drawn-out affair between Tampa Bay and Columbus that ended when Lightning forward Brayden Point beat Blue Jackets goalie Joonas Korpisalo at 10:27 of the fifth overtime.Point was so tired after 150:27 of hockey that he could barely get off the ground while trying to jump in celebration.“Finally, one goes in. I think that’s the emotion,” he said. “Just super-excited.”Korpisalo was beaten on the game’s final shot but set an NHL playoff record with 85 saves, snapping the mark of 73 set by the New York Islanders’ Kelly Hrudey in a four-overtime win over the Washington Capitals in the 1987 Patrick Division semifinals. The teams combined for 151 shots on goal, the most in a playoff game since that statistic began being officially tabulated in 1959-60.2003 Western Conference semifinalsAnaheim entered Game 1 of the 2003 Western Conference semifinals having already played two overtime games — and four overtime periods — in its first-round sweep of the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. It added four-plus more extra periods in its opening game against Dallas, which ended when Petr Sykora scored 48 seconds into the fifth overtime.The Ducks led 3-1 in the second period but surrendered two goals, the last coming with just 2:47 left in regulation when a deflection by Brenden Morrow tied the score. Anaheim thought it had won the game in the third overtime when the puck went in off Steve Thomas’s leg, but the officials ruled that the net had become dislodged and waved off the goal.Naturally, the next game also went to overtime, though the Ducks ended it after only 1:44 of extra time.2023 Eastern Conference finalsFlorida’s Matthew Tkachuk barely prevented a fifth overtime Thursday night, beating Carolina goalie Frederik Andersen with 12.7 seconds left in the fourth extra period. It was the Panthers’ fifth overtime game of the playoffs, and they’ve won every single one of them.The game appeared to end early in the first overtime, but Carolina successfully challenged a goal by Florida’s Ryan Lomberg, with the officials ruling that Colin White interfered with Anderson on the shot. The Hurricanes’ Seth Jarvis also nearly ended things later in the first extra period, but his shot rang off the crossbar.In case you were wondering, the longest Stanley Cup finals game took place in 1990, when Edmonton defeated Boston, 3-2, on Petr Klima’s goal at 15:13 of the third overtime in Game 1.",

      "title": "Perspective | The slow cracking of Greg the Egg",
      "text": "There was a time, a haircut or two ago, when Cousin Greg had major reservations about ATN, the fictional right-wing news network and flagship operation of Waystar Royco, the media empire owned by the Roy family of HBO’s “Succession.”“It’s like — it’s kind of against my principles?” Greg stammers to Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen), his boss and cousin-in-law.“Your principles?” Tom purrs through an amused grin. “You don’t have principles.”Actually, Greg explains, he’s against racism. Also? “Don’t lie. Like, if you’re the news.”If you’ve talked to any “Succession” skeptics about why they can’t stomach the show, they might have argued that there’s no character worth rooting for. To which you might reply: What about Cousin Greg?Callow, hapless Greg Hirsch. Born with a misshapen body (hence his family nickname, “Greg the Egg”) and a normal-shaped conscience, the gawky grandson of Logan Roy’s moralizing brother has been the closest thing viewers have to a proxy inside the Roy family.It would be a stretch to call him the show’s moral center. When we first met Greg (Nicholas Braun), he was lying to his mom about the circumstances of his getting fired from a gig as a mascot at one of the family-owned theme parks. (He got stoned before work and then vomited through the costume’s eye holes after being beaten up by some children.) His mother asked him why, to avoid losing the job, he didn’t pull rank as a member of the extended Roy family. Greg explained that he “didn’t want to be an a--hole.”That, at least, distinguished Greg from his cousins and the other Waystar lifers. When Greg comes to New York and joins the family business (his mom’s idea), his attempts to work the angles of the corporate world are endearingly pathetic. Greg might not have been a good person, he wasn’t obviously a bad person. You mostly felt embarrassed for him, which was not quite the same as rooting for him. “Relatable” is not quite the word, but the fact that he appeared so ill at ease in Royworld put him on our side.Four seasons in, Greg the Egg has hatched into something slimy. Lately we’ve seen him brag about his ability to fire people without feeling remorse. He’s been leaning so hard into a dirtbag persona that even Tom can’t stand it. As for those principles of his — Don’t be racist. Don’t lie if you’re the news — those fell away Sunday, when Greg hand-delivered a directive to ATN’s news producers to prematurely call a presidential race for a nativist creep who refers to Adolf Hitler as “H” and envisions an America that is “clean” and “pure.”The corruption of Cousin Greg is a sneaky-poignant subplot of “Succession,” a show populated mostly by characters who were broken long before we met them. Greg arrived at the same time we did. His induction to the Roy inner circle was kind of a twisted “Truman Show” experiment: What would happen if a more or less decent guy spent several years ensconced in a world of decadence, surrounded by beguiling scoundrels and high-functioning depressives for whom everything is not nearly enough?How long would it take for a guy like that to stop caring about whether he was being an a--hole?Greg is splayed at the stern of the family yacht, sipping from a champagne flute at an angle that requires him to lift his head as little as possible.“What are you drinking?” Tom asks him.“Uh, this is — I’m not sure,” Greg says. “It’s a rosé, it’s not my favorite.”“Oh, you got a favorite Champagne now?”“Well, you can’t help noticing. It’s fine, I’ll drink it, it’s just not my favorite.”It’s the Season 2 finale, and Cousin Greg is growing spoiled. When they boarded the yacht, Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) had been slightly surprised by his cousin’s blasé reaction — a contrast to earlier in the season, when Greg got the zoomies after Kendall gifted him a gigantic Manhattan apartment.The yacht trip comes on the heels of Greg’s initiation into a different Roy family tradition: Trying to dodge government oversight. His performance before a congressional panel, where Greg and various Roys faced questions about seedy doings in Waystar’s cruises division, produced this memorable koan: “If it is to be said, so it be, so it is.” Later, Greg — no longer in the hot seat — laments that he did not stymie the watchdogs by answering every question with, “No woman, no cry.”Greg, in his idiot way, learned the importance of fealty to family/corporate interests. He started to look the part, too, getting his shaggy hair shaped up in attempt to curb the stress of preserving shady company secrets (“I didn’t really need a haircut, I think I just wanted someone to touch my head — you know, soothing”). He hasn’t broken bad, but he is adjusting to his material and moral circumstances.How ‘Succession’ is — and isn’t — about Rupert Murdoch and FoxThere is, to use the show’s vernacular, a lot of static. When Logan Roy (Brian Cox) makes Kendall his fall guy for abuses in the company’s cruises division, Greg suffers an attack of conscience and aligns himself with Kendall’s rebellion. It doesn’t last. Unable to separate his interests from his anxiety, Greg spends much of the Roy civil war trying to figure out who his lawyer is. In the process he alienates his grandfather, who disinherits him.Having burned his final bridge back to life as a shiftless kid with a trust fund, Greg returns to the Waystar fold in time to watch Kendall’s insurgency collapse. The lesson is clear enough: Stay inside the compound.You can’t really get into the moral dimensions of Greg without getting into Tom. He gets a lot of the blame for corrupting Greg, and deservedly so. As the old proverb says, You can’t make a Tomlette without breaking some Greggs. But while Greg has spent the final season reveling in the person he has been allowed to become by going full Roy, Tom has been retreating toward his inner Wambsgans.After Logan’s midflight demise, he serves as an ad hoc grief counselor to his estranged in-laws, talking them through the act of saying goodbye to their father while holding his phone to the dead man’s ear. He may not have principles, per se, but he has instincts. There’s a foundation down there, somewhere. Tom owns the rare distinction of being a character on “Succession” who definitely loves someone. That love is poorly directed, but at least we know he’s capable of it. He likes rich-people stuff, yet it’s his affection for Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) that drives Tom to compromise.Ah, well — no woman, no cry. Tom may be seeing the Roy family more clearly than ever, but as the head of ATN he’s still carrying their water. And Greg is still carrying his water, and also doing cocaine with him on election night.Yes, the election! We’ll get to it in a moment. But first, let’s rewind one night earlier: Tom and Shiv’s pre-election party.Greg is smoking a vape pen with Swedish tech bros, and telling them about the mass firings of ATN employees he has been conducting over videoconference.“You said a hundred scalps, in three days?” says Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgard), the billionaire who is trying to buy the Roys’ company. He’s impressed, and wonders if Greg feels bad afterward.“Honestly, not really,” Greg says. He is stoned, like when we met him years ago, only now he’s in a tailored suit instead of a dog costume. And, of course, he’s on the other end of the firing stick. “HR says I’m the right guy for the job because it looks like I care but I don’t.”“Not a good person,” says the Swede.“No, I am. It’s just — you gotta do what you gotta do, right?”Matsson doesn’t let Greg off the hook. “Do you, though?”Greg has learned how to swing an ax; on election night, he figures out how to wield a knife. His dalliance with the Swedes has yielded a lethal piece of intel about Shiv, which Greg tries to use to extort her. When she refuses, he uses it to cut her throat — swinging the Roy family vote, and therefore America’s, to the right. At the behest of the Roy brothers, Tom dispatches Greg to have ATN get ready to call the election for the neo-fascist.“I should go,” Greg tells Jess, Kendall’s assistant. “I’ll get in trouble if I don’t go.”Jess, famously taciturn, speaks up. “Okay dude, I mean ...”“Yeah. I mean it’s not really my choice, right? So.” The rationalizations continue. “I’m not even pressing the button, I’m asking them to prepare to press the button.”“Right, and, all that does is, just, like, launch a nuclear attack, so ...”“It’s not going to change anything if I don’t go, so ...”Greg did have a choice. The problem was, he made it a few seasons ago. “Succession” is a show about people who have learned to act as if they’re in a knife fight when really they’re just carving up a cake. You gotta do what you gotta do ... Do you, though?Answered: If it is to be said, so it be. So it is.An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Greg Hirsch was disinherited by his great-uncle. It was his grandfather. This version has been corrected.",

      "title": "Why a Starbucks ad on trans rights sparked joy and fury in India",
      "text": "An advert by Starbucks India hopes to turn one of the brand’s most recognizable gestures — writing a customer’s name on a cup — into a powerful message about inclusivity.The two minute ad, which went viral this week, shows a transgender woman meeting with her estranged family over coffee. The meeting is tense at first — the mother has already pleaded to the father, “don’t get angry this time, please.” As the daughter tries to reconcile with her father, he solemnly stands up — as if to walk away. But it turns out he is just ordering coffees for everyone — and as the barista calls out the daughter’s new name, Arpita, she realizes this is his way of showing he has accepted her identity.The ad, starring prominent transgender model Siya Malasi and featuring the hashtag #ItStartsWithYourName, was viewed more than 12 million times on Twitter and Facebook. It has divided public opinion and highlighted the complexity of gender and social acceptance in the world’s largest democracy.Several Indians demanded a boycott of Starbucks, with one accusing Starbucks of “imposing western culture in India” and another saying he would “never again” use the company. However, the advert also sparked a strong response from supporters, with some thanking Starbucks for their “good work.” One wrote: “This is an incredible ad so let’s hope that the LGBTQ+ community finds more such allies.”A bill meant to protect India’s transgender community instead leaves them angry and aggrievedWhile the backlash mirrors similar controversies in other countries — including the United States, where beer brand Bud Light faced a boycott over a can of beer featuring a transgender actress — India has a long history with transgender rights. Even as some Indians derided the Starbucks India advert as “woke” or “preaching” from a Western corporation, others argued that the outrage was in fact a sign that the culture wars commonly seen in Western societies were being “imported” into India.“The very idea of trans-inclusion isn’t something radical within the cultural context” of India, said Anish Gawande, founder of advocacy group Pink List India. Instead, the issue seems to be “becoming embroiled in a sort of cultural war that has seeped in from the U.S. and from the transphobic rhetoric from the U.K. into India.”Your name defines who you are - whether it's Arpit or Arpita. At Starbucks, we love and accept you for who you are. Because being yourself means everything to us. #ItStartsWithYourName. 💚 pic.twitter.com/DKNGhKZ1HgAcross much of South Asia and Southeast Asia, the language of gender is more fluid than it is in the West, and hijras, as the transgender Indian community is sometimes known, have been a part of the country’s society and culture since ancient times. They are highly visible in some aspects of Indian life — often seen at weddings where some consider it auspicious to give them money — even as activists say the community faces discrimination, limited job opportunities and inadequate protection of their rights.The country has taken steps to recognize and protect transgender people — creating a “third gender” status for transgender people in 2014, passing a law prohibiting discrimination and criminalizing physical abuse against the transgender community in 2019 — though many trans activists criticized the law as insufficient and regressive.Historically, “India is a county where people have coexisted” reasonably well with the transgender community, Gawande said, though he added that increased polarization — which he partly blamed on western culture wars — had made life more difficult for transgender people in recent years. “The warning bells have started ringing.”Of course, advertising choices are also informed by financial decisions, as companies weigh the costs and benefits of engaging in social issues.In recent years, some brands in India have sought to position themselves as more inclusive — but faced anger from conservative right-wing quarters, where there is a movement to boycott companies with adverts they disagree with.Advertisements about interfaith issues have become particularly risky, as relations between India’s Hindu majority and minority Muslims have come increasingly under strain since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government assumed power in 2014.In 2020, Indian jewelry brand Tanishq produced an advert about interfaith marriage — but pulled it just days later, after a flood of angry calls from Hindu nationalists demanding people boycott the firm. A year earlier, another ad for detergent from SurfExcel aiming to present religious unity also elicited a boycott.By contrast, a 2021 advert by jewelry brand Bhima starring a transgender model gained mostly positive responses at the time.India’s Supreme Court is hearing a hotly contested case about same-sex marriage, which appears to have brought about wider discussion of LGBT issues.Indian government opposes same-sex marriage, warns of countrywide ‘havoc’Starbucks has been present in India for more than a decade since opening its first store in Mumbai in 2012. It operates a joint venture partnership with Indian conglomerate Tata and has more than 300 stores dotted across 36 cities.“Our campaign in India, #ItStartsWithYourName, shows how Tata Starbucks is committed to making people of all backgrounds and identities feel welcome,” and “show up as their authentic selves every day,” the company said in a statement to The Washington Post in response to the backlash.“We will continue to use our voice to advocate for greater understanding on the importance of inclusion and diversity across the communities we serve around the world.”An Indian jewelry brand made a touching ad about an interfaith marriage. Outrage ensued.Karthik Srinivasan, a communications strategy consultant based in Bangalore, said in an interview that it wasn’t necessary for brands to have social messages to be successful but added that Starbucks had been “consistent” with its messaging on LGBT rights, running similar campaigns in the United Kingdom and Brazil.Starbucks India likely did not intend for the advert to cause so much controversy, he said, adding: “The backlash is really unfortunate considering it merely shows people being inclusive, considerate, and accepting of differences.”For Zayan, a transgender man based in Delhi, the ad has “some merit” but was “a little tokenistic,” targeting “people who have a lot of privilege” while many Indians would be unlikely to afford Starbucks.The ad might help encourage people in India to become better allies to trans communities, he said, but also noted that many “corporates become hyperactive around the month of June” — when India marks Pride month — while overlooking LGBT issues “the other 11 months of the year.”Karishma Mehrotra and Niha Masih contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Angels employee imprisoned for Tyler Skaggs’s death files an appeal",
      "text": "Eric Kay, the former Los Angeles Angels communications director convicted of giving pitcher Tyler Skaggs the drugs that caused his death in 2019, argued in an appeal filed Monday that prosecutors misstated evidence and failed to prove the charges that sent him to prison for 22 years.Kay’s attorneys claimed that in securing his conviction last fall for drug conspiracy and distributing a controlled substance resulting in death, the government never proved Kay actually gave Skaggs the pill prosecutors said killed him.In the brief Monday, the lawyers argued that prosecutors misled the jury by claiming that Kay was Skaggs’s only source for drugs, that no evidence had been deleted from Skaggs’s phone following his death, and even that indentations on a hotel room couch were evidence Kay was there — and did nothing — while Skaggs died. Those claims and others were debunked through court testimony and evidence, Kay’s attorneys argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.“Tyler Skaggs’s death was tragic,” wrote Kay’s attorneys, led by Texas attorney Brett Ordiway. “There’s plenty of blame to go around: cartels that flood American streets with camouflaged fentanyl; physicians who recklessly prescribe powerfully addictive narcotics; Skaggs himself, a grown man who chose to crush and snort illegally obtained pills; and yes, Eric Kay, who helped nourish Skaggs’s addiction. But the Government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kay gave Skaggs the drugs that caused his death.”Kay was convicted by a jury within three hours following a trial made sensational by the testimony of several of Skaggs’s former teammates, including one-time star pitcher Matt Harvey, who stated Kay had previously supplied them with oxycodone — though there was no evidence he did so for profit. Court testimony showed that Kay, himself a drug addict, initially lied to police about whether he was aware Skaggs also used drugs. After initially stating he felt the mandatory 20-year minimum sentence for the charges was “excessive,” District Judge Terry Means added on two years because of unremorseful comments Kay made in recorded phone conversations from jail.Skaggs’s family has sued the Angels, claiming the team allowed Kay “unrestricted access” to players despite knowledge of his drug abuse. Rusty Hardin, an attorney for Skaggs’s family, said Monday in response to Kay’s appeal: “The jury got it, Eric Kay and the Angels continue not to.”The Angels declined to comment on Kay’s appeal. The team has denied the allegations in the lawsuit filed by Skaggs’s family.In the appeal brief, Kay’s attorneys argued the government relied on thin, circumstantial evidence to show he bought the deadly pill in California and then gave it to Skaggs after the team arrived in Dallas on a road trip on July 1, 2019.Kay’s attorneys argued cell phone data used by the government as evidence he met with a suspected drug dealer in fact only showed they were within a few miles of each other. Skaggs texted Kay his room number the night of his death, which prosecutors seized on as evidence Kay brought him the pill.But Kay’s attorneys argued the version of events he shared with a coworker was just as likely: that Kay “arrived emptyhanded and Skaggs offered him a crushed-up line,” which Kay then declined to snort. Kay did not testify in his own defense at trial.A prosecutor also told the jury Skaggs’s only source for drugs was Kay and there was no evidence messages were deleted from Skaggs’s phone after he died, despite testimony contradicting both claims, Kay’s lawyers argued. As for the “depression” on a couch in Skaggs’s room that a prosecutor suggested was evidence Kay sat there, Kay’s attorneys argued a police officer testified he had not seen “any wrinkles in the cushions or anything indicating that anyone had sat there.”Following the verdict, one of Kay’s trial attorneys was disbarred in a separate matter. Kay has claimed that when prosecutors initially offered him a plea deal that could have gotten him released in five years, his other trial attorney “belittled him for considering it and threatened to withdraw from the case” if he accepted, according to the appeal brief. Kay, 48, is serving his sentence at FCI Englewood, a federal prison in Colorado, with a release date in 2041.",

      "title": "Commanders begin rookie minicamp with new vibes from top to bottom",
      "text": "If anything, the Commanders’ rookie class of 2023 received an introduction like no other in recent years.Less than an hour after the team’s drafted rookies, signed college free agents and tryout players walked off the practice field in Ashburn, news broke of an exclusive agreement between Daniel Snyder and a group led by Josh Harris to purchase the Commanders.The rookies could begin their careers with Harris as their owner should the agreement be ratified before the regular season.But to get there, they have to make it through a grueling couple of days of practice, followed by the continuation of organized team activities with veteran players next week.After hiring Eric Bieniemy as its offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, Washington not only restructured its offensive coaching staff (the team hasn’t announced new titles yet) but also revised its day-to-day operations. Bieniemy brought over some things from his time with the Kansas City Chiefs working under Coach Andy Reid.“I’d been in the same system doing things a specific way, and I felt the shake-up is good and it’s good for me as well,” Commanders Coach Ron Rivera said. “It is a whole different approach. One of the things that [Bieniemy] did differently, and I think that he adapted a little bit of what they had done in Kansas City under Andy … [was] we [changed] the way the offensive coaching staff is going to be structured. We’ve moved some guys around over a couple of positions so they can help the younger coaches that we’ve elevated as well. And a big part of it is, for EB, it gives him channels of communication.”Bieniemy also has the staff on a different regimen. Offensive coaches start their days at 7 a.m. and “go through everything,” Rivera said.The Commanders turned up the intensity at rookie camp on purpose: They want to see how the prospects handle an overload of information. How quickly do they grasp the system? How well can they apply the classroom teachings to the field?“Hopefully it’ll be one of those things that the guys, their retention is very good,” Rivera said. “They’ll be able to re-adapt and assimilate to how we’re doing it.”First-round pick Emmanuel Forbes, whom the team listed at 173 pounds, wasted little time in getting his first interception of practice. The former Mississippi State cornerback picked off Tim DeMorat, a free agent signing out of Fordham, on a pass intended for wide receiver Kyric McGowan during seven-on-seven drills. Forbes later broke up a pass during 11-on-11 action.The Commanders invited 35 players to try out during rookie camp — another offseason change in which Bieniemy had a hand.“Well, what we wanted to do was we wanted to have basically two full units, offensive and defensive,” Rivera said. “ … We felt being able to get a lot of work for the coaches as well was going be important, and it was also one of the things that Eric really felt strongly about doing.”One tryout player who made an impression was Jadakis Bonds, a 6-foot-4 wide receiver from Hampton University. Bonds pulled in a catch in tight coverage on a deep ball and used his size to create separation. He could be a candidate to fill the void left by Cam Sims, who signed with the Las Vegas Raiders in free agency.And, yes, he was named after the rapper “Jadakiss.”“My aunt actually named me that,” Bonds said.Bonds was one of five tryout players from historically Black colleges and universities. A sixth, former Bowie State defensive end Joshua Pryor, signed as a college free agent.“If you can play, they’re going to find you,” Bonds said. “ … We were able to come out here and showcase our HBCU talent and show what HBCUs can do.”One college free agent to follow: Kazmeir Allen, a wide receiver/returner out of UCLA. Allen played multiple positions in UCLA’s offense and returned punts and kickoffs.“He’s a young man that most certainly has gotten our attention, and he’s a young guy that we went out and tried to make sure we were able to recruit and bring him in as a free agent,” Rivera said.Rivera had a tempered reaction to the Commanders’ 2023 schedule, which includes a Week 14 bye, only one prime-time game and a Thanksgiving game in Dallas. The holiday meeting will be the Commanders’ 11th all-time, and their first since they beat the Cowboys, 41-16, in 2020.“It’s all right,” Rivera said of the schedule. “It’ll be fun to have the Thanksgiving game again. That’s kind of cool, and other than that I wish the bye might have been a little bit sooner, but again, we’ll take it where it is.”Three of the Commanders’ draft picks — fifth-round defensive end K.J. Henry, sixth-round running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. and seventh-round defensive end Andre Jones — signed their rookie contracts Friday. All 12 of the team’s undrafted free agents also passed their physicals and signed their contracts.Second-round safety Quan Martin was excused for rookie minicamp to tend to a family matter. He is expected to join the team for the next phase of OTAs.The Commanders released wide receiver Alex Erickson and linebacker Drew White to get to 90 players on their roster.",

      "title": "Zelensky, on surprise Saudi visit, seeks Arab League support in war",
      "text": "In a surprise appearance at an Arab League meeting in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday delivered an emotional appeal for support from leaders who have voiced only muted criticism of Russia’s invasion and from some, like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who have maintained strong ties to Moscow despite the war.Zelensky, who has repeatedly used his personal charisma to build global support for Ukraine’s defense and obtain billions of dollars in weapons from the West, sought to make common cause with countries that have experienced their own years of violent strife as he pleaded for stronger condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression.“Look at how much suffering the long-term wars have brought to Libya, Syria, Yemen; how many lives have been wasted by years of fighting in Sudan and Somalia, in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Zelensky said, speaking in English. “Everyone who adds to suffering by his new aggressions, everyone who sows enmity, everyone who wants to bring back the old days of invading … every aggressor … will be cursed by the people.”“I greet everyone who is ready to join us on the path to justice,” he said. As he does in many of his public speeches, Zelensky carefully tailored his message to his audience, mentioning most countries by name and appealing to both Muslim unity and anti-imperialism. In particular, he returned repeatedly to the plight of Ukraine’s Crimean Tatar population, which he described as “the center of Muslim culture in Ukraine.”“For centuries the Crimean Tatars have been, and should remain, an integral and strong part of the Muslim community of the world, but Crimea was the first to suffer from the Russian occupation, and until now most of those who are subjected to repression in the occupied Crimea are Muslims,” Zelensky said, referring to Russia’s illegal invasion and annexation of the peninsula in 2014.“I believe that one day your people will come back also to see our Crimea — Ukrainian Crimea free from Russian occupation and humiliation,” he said.Friday’s Arab League meeting was particularly notable for the return of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who was attending for the first time since being suspended from the regional group 12 years ago. Assad was ostracized by many fellow leaders after his violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators triggered a brutal civil war in which hundreds of thousands were killed.Russia’s Ukraine war builds on tactics it used in Syria, experts sayAssad owes his political survival to Russia, which intervened in the war and carried out brutal bombing campaigns against anti-government forces. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, which is now fighting in Ukraine, was also active in Syria.So it was striking that Assad, who presided over the flattening of cities in his own country, appeared in the same room as Zelensky, some of whose cities have been practically obliterated by relentless Russian bombing.Saudi Arabia in particular has maintained strong ties with Russia, particularly over oil production, and has benefited heavily from the West’s search for alternatives to Russian energy sources.Zelensky, however, noted Saudi Arabia’s assistance in negotiating prisoner exchanges and said he hoped all leaders present would support efforts to free such captives.Arab embrace of Assad underscores divergence with U.S. over Syria“We can expand this experience,” he said, “and even if there are people here at the summit who have a different view of the war on our land, calling it a conflict, I think we can all be united in saving people from the cages of Russian prisons.”“Unfortunately, there are some in the world and here among you who turn a blind eye to those cages and illegal annexations,” he continued, “and I am here so that everyone can take an honest look no matter how hard the Russians try to influence.”Zelensky emphasized Ukraine’s other ties to Arab nations. He cited tourists from Persian Gulf states who visited Ukraine before the war and the “education of tens of thousands of Arab students in our universities every year.” He also noted Ukraine’s role as an agricultural supplier in providing wheat to the region, notably to countries such as Lebanon and Egypt that were directly threatened by Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea until a deal was implemented last year.Arab embrace of Assad underscores divergence with U.S. over SyriaMost of the countries represented at the summit voted in favor of U.N. resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a violation of the U.N. Charter, which calls for respect of each nation’s territorial sovereignty. But many Arab nations have generally displayed ambivalence to the plight of Ukraine.Multiple leaders in attendance at the summit spoke out against foreign involvement in their own region — including, with perhaps the least credibility, Assad. “Today is an historic opportunity to rearrange our affairs with the least amount of foreign interference,” he said.Zelensky, clearly aiming to stir empathy, made repeated references in his speech to anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism in an unequivocal moral appeal to the region’s leaders and their own histories.“Anyone who defends his native land from invaders, and anyone who defends children of his nation from enslavement — every such warrior is on the path of justice, and I am proud to represent such warriors,” he said.“I am more than sure that none of you will agree to surrender a third of your country to the invaders,” Zelensky said. Then, referring to the International Criminal Court’s indictment of Putin on war crimes charges, he added: “I am more than sure that none of you would watch without a fight how foreigners steal the children of your people. Hundreds of thousands of our children are deported to Russia, separated from their relatives.”Portraits of Ukraine: Every Ukrainian’s life has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion one year ago — in ways both big and small.

      "title": "At G-7 summit, leaders call for international standards on AI",
      "text": "HIROSHIMA, Japan — The leaders of the world’s largest economies on Saturday called for international standards for rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, making clear that the push was a priority but failing to come to any significant conclusions about how to handle the emerging technology.The use of artificial intelligence — such as chatbots, ChatGPT and self-driving cars — has become increasingly prevalent, forcing policymakers and business leaders around the world to grapple with how to support innovation while also putting in guardrails to reduce their potential harm, including privacy attacks, civil rights violations, disinformation and the unethical use of data.In their joint statement Saturday, leaders of the world’s richest democracies gathered for the Group of Seven summit, acknowledged that despite the rapid growth of AI and immersive technologies such as metaverses, international rules governing their use and compliance have “not necessarily kept pace.”They said while such new technologies bring opportunities to promote sustainability and innovation in various industries, their challenges must be considered alongside the benefits. New technologies should be governed in line with democratic values, they wrote — including fairness, accountability, transparency, protection from online abuse and respect for privacy and human rights.Specifically, the G-7 leaders called out the use of generative AI, or the production of text, images and other content that resembles human-created work. The popularization of ChatGPT has raised concerns about the ability of generative AI to create humanlike responses and train itself to improve its accuracy.As democracies around the world face deepening polarization and misinformation, some experts warn that generative AI may exacerbate political division through machine-generated content and make it difficult for people to judge which information is trustworthy or factual.“We recognize the need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI, which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors,” the leaders wrote in the summit’s communiqué.The leaders also called for technical standards to develop “trustworthy” AI, adding that “approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members.”At Hiroshima summit, Japan to push against nukes — but world disagreesThe conversations at the summit come as the leaders are charting their own courses in their respective countries about how to handle AI advancements. The European Union is debating legislation on the regulation of AI. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was among the participants here.White House officials also hoped AI governance would be raised during the G-7 to discuss emerging issues of potential concern.During a session on the global economy on Friday, President Biden briefed his counterparts on a recent meeting held this month at the White House in which top executives from companies developing artificial intelligence such as Google and Microsoft discussed the technology. He also provided an update on the work the U.S. government is doing on a framework that balances the risks with the opportunities in the technology.“Other G-7 leaders spoke to this issue as well,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said at a briefing on Saturday. “I think this is a topic that is very much seizing the attention of leaders of all of these key, advanced democratic market economies.”There are different elements to the discussions at the summit, he said, including what each country decides to do in their own countries to pass laws and regulations on the technology. They also have to consider whether there is a global role.“How do we come together in an international format to effectively try to align approaches so that we’re dealing with this incredibly fast-moving technology with these incredibly far-reaching implications?” he said, characterizing the discussion here as “a good start.”G-7 leaders directed their countries’ top officials to work together on the issue and establish the “Hiroshima AI process” to discuss generative AI and report back by the end of 2023.“Leaders have tasked their teams to work together on what the right format would be for an international discussion around norms and standards going forward,” Sullivan said.",

      "title": "Can Angelina Jolie make us care about sustainability?",
      "text": "Angelina Jolie has made a reputation for herself as one of Hollywood’s foremost humanitarians, harnessing our attention for refugees, war-zone sexual assault and international adoption — but can she change the way we think about clothes?On Wednesday, the actor introduced Atelier Jolie, a fashion business with an unorthodox and purpose-driven business model. “Atelier Jolie wants to join others in their effort to democratize the fashion industry, allowing the customers to have access to a collective of emerging designers and master artisans,” she wrote in an Instagram caption accompanying an image of a brand logo in jangly art-deco-style font over a leathery metallic gold background.Aside from its fall launch date, the brand has made few details available — “Bear with me,” Jolie signed off on her introductory note. “I hope to grow this with you” — but hints at an ambitious, globalist aim. “I am building a place for creative people to collaborate with a skilled and diverse family of expert tailors, patternmakers and artisans from around the world,” she writes on the brand’s site. “A place to have fun. To create your own designs with freedom. To discover yourself.”Emphasizing the global reach of an industry deeply entrenched in Western values has become the luxury business’s new obsession over the past year. Chanel staged a fashion show in Senegal last December, while Gucci mounted one in Korea earlier this month. Dior has highlighted their use of Indian ateliers for embroidery — a practice many French luxury businesses engage in but often go to lengths to obscure in the name of preserving French artisanship.Still, the business remains oriented around Western notions of luxury. Jolie’s brand seems aimed to disrupt that, if gently. “When you’re using language in the fashion industry space — and by that I mean, this Western-centric and U.S. version of the fashion industry as we know it, with fashion month in New York and Paris and Milan and London — [like] ‘atelier’ and ‘tailoring’ and ‘craftsmanship,’ that codes to me as very high end,” says Emma McClendon, a fashion historian and assistant professor of fashion studies at St. John’s University in New York.On the other hand, McClendon says, “consider how clothing is made around the world, and actually, this notion of engaging with textiles, engaging with tailors, getting custom-made stuff is not necessarily [in] the upper echelons of clothing production in other parts of the world.” In many parts of Africa, China and India, it’s neither unusual nor expensive to have a neighborhood tailor make your garments. Perhaps Atelier Jolie can offer “a more global perspective,” says McClendon, showing “who has these skills and elevating them and giving them visibility.”Clothing brands are popular means for celebrities to trade on their names — everyone from Rihanna to Beyoncé to Kate Hudson to Tyler, the Creator has had their name on brand tag. But Atelier Jolie suggests the actress is not out to proselytize for her own sense of style. First, consider Jolie’s status within the fashion industry itself; unlike Rihanna or the Olsens, she is not known as a fashion plate, instead choosing a wardrobe of neutral suiting separates by subdued luxury brands such as MaxMara and Michael Kors. In recent years, she’s made headlines in the style world when her children have re-worn her gowns from past red carpet moments — a “vintage” style statement hinting at her own shifting perspective.On the brand’s website, Jolie declares an intention to “use only leftover, quality vintage material and deadstock.” (Deadstock fabrics are excess materials unused by brands or mills.) That would put Atelier Jolie more in line with ethical luxury brands such as Bode and By Walid, which make pieces from antique textiles and quilts; and Marine Serre, a Paris-based designer who almost exclusively uses deadstock T-shirts, towels, and linens. This production model means that these brands are small — there is only so much old stuff to be made into newer goods. (Bode, by the American Emily Adams Bode Aujla, has expanded her business by adding reproduction garments to her lineup.) Neither is it cheap: a By Walid jacket can cost upward of $3,000.For as popular as the term may be, sustainability remains a hard sell in fashion. (Notably, Jolie does not use it.) Businesses that emphasize recycled fabrics and upcycled deadstock may earn a lot of press, but they are up against a seemingly unstoppable machine of fast fashion, whose star brand, Shein, a business valued at $64 billion this year. When it comes to sustainable goods, consumers are often motivated by the same desires behind any other fashion purchase: a thirst for novelty. Can she get us to change our ways?Perhaps McClendon says it best: “I’m going to be really disappointed if it’s just a product roll out.”",

      "title": "These are the Western air defense systems protecting Ukraine",
      "text": "Air defense systems have proved essential to Ukraine as Russia bombards critical infrastructure and civilian targets.This week, the newly arrived U.S.-made Patriot air defense system shot down missiles aimed at Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said, including advanced missiles that have previously eluded outmatched air defense equipment.The Patriot is just one of several systems that Western allies have sent to Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year to help shore up Kyiv’s defenses. The systems form a grab bag of different capabilities and technologies that are vital in defending the skies from missiles, fighter jets and Iranian-made drones that have terrorized the capital.But according to leaked U.S. intelligence documents produced in February and March, the supply of air defense systems and their munitions pose a significant and growing problem, as Ukraine uses up their limited stocks to keep up with constant bombardments. Kyiv risks running low on their most common Soviet-era systems, the documents warned, forcing commanders to select what can and cannot be shot down.How air defense worksThat dynamic underscores the inherent challenge, experts have said: Air defense is a difficult mission using expensive and finite resources, with no silver bullets. To address that, the West has ramped up its commitments to Ukraine, sending a range of gear, from truck-mounted guns to the most modern missile-killing systems the United States has to offer.Here is a rundown of the Western-provided systems Ukraine now has, and what they can do.Leaked documents warn of weaknesses in Ukraine’s defensesThe Patriot is the U.S. military’s most advanced air defense system, with a range of roughly 20 to 100 miles, depending on the threat. It was designed as an antiaircraft system, but newer variants of Patriot can also engage ballistic and cruise missiles and drones.How the system worksA typical Patriot battery includes a radar set, engagement control station, power generation and several launch stations. 1 Radar2 Command andcontrol3 MissilelauncherLaunching StationMissile CanistersThese canisters store the Patriot’s interceptors.

Each Patriot interceptor missile costs an estimated $4 million, putting a premium on each decision to fire. Ukrainian officials have said one Russian strategy is to attempt to exhaust air defense systems by saturating the sky with targets, some of which are decoys meant to confuse the interceptor, allowing the real missile to slip through.The NASAMS suite — short for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems — includes a command post, sensors, a radar system and munitions that can be fired from a stand-alone pod or from the back of a truck. This is the air defense system used to protect the White House.Its radar can detect threats up to roughly 80 miles away, depending on variables including the weather and the size and altitude of a target.The NASAMS utilizes the same kind of missiles already in common use with Western fighter jets, so their weapon stocks are cheaper and more widely available than the costly Patriot interceptors.NASAMSSystemcomponentsNASAMS (National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) is a short-to-medium-range ground-based air defense system.

It’s a tier below the Patriot system and is configured to use missiles initially designed for fighter jets.The heat-seeking missile has a medium range of around 20 miles and has proved effective against Russian cruise missiles, said Ian Williams, deputy director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The problem with [the IRIS-T] is sourcing it,” Williams added.

Some versions are up to 50 years old.It is no longer used in the United States, but many U.S. allies still operate the Hawk, including Spain which has sent the system to Ukraine. The United States took some Hawks out of storage to send to Ukraine as well. While the system is older than others Ukraine has, it can be useful against some lower-quality Russian missiles.I-Hawk system componentsThe Hawk system is the predecessor to Patriot missile defense.

It’s a more basic system which can easily be operated by soldiers who only need to see a threat and fire.They have been most useful, Williams said, in intercepting Iranian-made drones that Russia has used. “Gun systems have been really good at helping Ukrainians preserve their interceptor capacity,” he said. That has helped commanders save more complex and expensive systems for bigger threats, like aircraft and missiles.The Pentagon said last month it would provide nine such trucks armed with 30mm cannons, along with laser-guided rockets. Both systems, officials said, are intended to be used against drones.Counter-UnmannedAerial SystemThe 30mm gun trucks can detect, track and shoot air targets like drones, but also can fire on ground-based threats like enemy vehicles.Sources: Army Recognition Group.Counter-UnmannedAerial SystemThe 30mm gun trucks can detect, track and shoot air targets like drones, but also can fire on ground-based threats like enemy vehicles.Sources: Army Recognition Group.Counter-UnmannedAerial SystemThe 30mm gun trucks can detect, track and shoot air targets like drones, but also can fire on ground-based threats like enemy vehicles.Sources: Army Recognition Group.Karen DeYoung and Serhiy Morgunov contributed to this report.Portraits of Ukraine: Every Ukrainian’s life has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion one year ago — in ways both big and small.

      "title": "Analysis | The Trump down-ballot drag",
      "text": "We are all for trying new things in the generally staid business of polling. And this week, we encountered that.The National Review wrote about a survey from a pollster aligned with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) that gets at a key question: How much better off would the GOP be with DeSantis as its nominee? We have, of course, seen DeSantis generally performing better in the general election than Donald Trump. But this poll looked at the down-ballot effects for the Republican Party. And it showed the GOP doing better under DeSantis there, as well.The WPA Intelligence poll tested the “generic ballot” — would you vote for a generic Republican or a generic Democrat for Congress? — with both DeSantis and Trump at the top of the ticket. While a Trump-led GOP was tied on the generic ballot (44 percent to 44 percent), a DeSantis-led one was ahead by five points (47-42).This comes with caveats, the first being that this, again, was a DeSantis-aligned pollster (though the survey itself wasn’t conducted for DeSantis’s super PAC). Even if the polls themselves are solid, such pollsters can pick and choose which surveys they release, and they’ll often release the ones that make their candidate look good. Another is that the questions were asked of split samples — that is, different representative groups of people were asked with Trump leading the ballot than were asked with DeSantis leading it.But this isn’t the only poll showing this dynamic. Nor is it the only evidence that Trump has hurt and could continue to hurt the GOP down ballot.The idea appears to have been borrowed from another Republican pollster, Public Opinion Strategies. The latter recently released polls showing a similar dynamic in Arizona and Georgia: Trump costing the GOP 10 points on the generic ballot in Arizona and eight points in Georgia, relative to DeSantis.Were Trump to truly hurt the GOP like this in swing states — or even just a handful of points nationally — that would be a big deal.It turns out Public Opinion Strategies asked the question in other key swing states, and it found a more muted effect — albeit still being favorable to DeSantis on the whole. According to data shared with The Washington Post, a DeSantis-led GOP did better in Pennsylvania (by five points), in Michigan (by three points) and in Wisconsin (by one point), but it did one point worse in Nevada.(Public Opinion Strategies doesn’t have a formal relationship with DeSantis, but it has repeatedly conducted polling for outside groups that shows DeSantis performing better than Trump. These polls were conducted for a little-known group called the Citizen Awareness Project.)So all told, that’s seven polls showing a DeSantis-led GOP performing an average of more than four points better than a Trump-led one. It’s certainly something other pollsters could test and see if they get similar results.But it would make sense.The first reason is that Republicans have had three straight bad elections under Trump. And the evidence that this had to do with Trump and Trumpism is compelling. For instance, from our recap of Philip Wallach’s 2022 study:This is about Trump’s endorsements rather than Trump’s broader impact on the party, but it gets at how his style of candidacy isn’t good for the party as a whole. The “coattail effect” of presidential candidates is also well established. And even if it’s just Trump doing worse than DeSantis in the presidential race, it would stand to reason that would bleed into other races.The second is that we’ve actually seen this dynamic before.After the “Access Hollywood” tape was released in October 2016, it wasn’t just Trump who suffered; it was the GOP as a whole. As another GOP pollster, the Tarrance Group, noted at the time:And then there is what happened as Trump was securing the nomination in early 2016. What had been a consistent GOP advantage on the presidential generic ballot rather quickly became a consistent deficit.Things turned out okay for the GOP in 2016, despite all that polling. But that was owing in part to Hillary Clinton’s own problems as a candidate and the difficulty of a party’s holding the White House after a two-term presidency. Trump wound up losing the popular vote but winning the electoral college thanks to his big advantage among the inordinate number of people who didn’t like either major-party nominee.Everything since then confirms this was hardly a resounding affirmation of Trump’s political skills and broad appeal. And the idea that his party might do better with the political middle without him — both at the presidential level and down ballot — shouldn’t be too surprising.",

      "title": "Georgia D.A. investigating Trump hints at time frame for charges",
      "text": "The Atlanta-area district attorney investigating former president Donald Trump and his allies for potential election interference notified top county officials that most of her staff will work remotely for many days in the first three weeks of August, a signal she may file indictments in the high-profile case within that period.Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) had previously said in a letter to law enforcement officials that she would announce possible criminal indictments in the case between July 11 and Sept. 1.But in a letter Thursday to Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville, Willis appeared to narrow that window even further, writing that her office’s in-person staff will be reduced by about 70 percent on most Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays — the days when criminal grand juries are scheduled to meet — from July 31 to Aug. 18.She noted in the letter that most judges will be at a conference the first week of August, during which few in-person proceedings will be held, and she requested that no trials or in-person hearings be held Aug. 7-14. More than 20 other top county officials were copied on the letter, including Sheriff Pat Labat, the court clerk and the entire county judicial bench.Willis noted that during the remote period, “my leadership team, all armed investigators, my Case Intake Division, and personnel at the Juvenile Court building will be working every day.” She added that any in-person meetings scheduled during the outlined time frame would be handled directly by senior leadership.“Thank you for your consideration and assistance in keeping the Fulton County Judicial Complex safe during this time,” Willis wrote in the letter, which was first reported by the New York Times.Willis has been investigating Trump and his allies for potential interference in Georgia’s 2020 presidential election. A special grand jury investigating potential crimes concluded in January and recommended charges — though the panel’s final report and those recommendations remain under seal “to protect the rights of future defendants,” according to Judge Robert McBurney, who oversaw the special grand jury proceedings.Trump’s Georgia-based legal team has sought to quash any potential case before charges are unsealed. In March, attorneys for the former president pushed to recuse Willis’ office from any potential case and throw out the special grand jury’s final report and any evidence obtained during the investigation. The motion that was later joined by Cathy Latham, a Georgia Republican who served as an alternate Trump elector and has been named a target of the investigation.Willis pushed back in a Monday filing, writing that the Trump legal team’s motion was “procedurally flawed and advance arguments that lack merit.”On Tuesday, Trump’s attorneys requested three weeks to file a response to Willis’s motion. But in a Friday order, McBurney noted that the court “has received well over five hundred pages of briefing” on the issues raised. “That is plenty,” McBurney wrote, adding that there will be no more briefing unless it is requested by the court “in writing.”The move indicates a decisive order or a hearing is likely impending in the controversy — though McBurney gave no indication of his timetable.Willis has been investigating potential interference in Georgia’s elections for more than two years. She launched a criminal probe into potential election interference in March 2021 after The Washington Post published a phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), during which the former president told the state’s top election official he needed to “find 11,780 votes.”The district attorney had been eying this spring for announcing potential charges in the case but pushed that back amid the ongoing investigation. In recent developments, at least eight of the alternate Republican electors who were previously named targets of the investigation have accepted immunity in the case and are cooperating with prosecutors.But Willis’s decision to push a potential charging announcement into the summer was also driven by concerns about the readiness of local law enforcement in a case that has national implications and for which she and her office have been the subject of threats.Last year, she asked the FBI for security assistance after Trump attacked her during a Texas rally.In recent months, Trump, who continues to maintain the 2020 election in Georgia was “stolen,” has renewed his attacks on Willis, who is Black, calling her the “racist D.A. from Atlanta.”“In the wings, they’ve got a local racist Democrat district attorney from Atlanta who is doing everything in her power to indict me over an absolutely perfect phone call,” Trump told supporters in April just hours after he was criminally charged in a New York tax case.Weeks later, Willis first notified local and state law enforcement about her summer timetable, urging a “need for heightened security and preparedness in coming months due to this pending announcement.”",

      "title": "At the PGA, ‘Double Trouble’ No. 6 lays a deep leader board to waste",
      "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. — All golf majors are real, but some are realer than others, and this 105th PGA Championship looks like one of the realest. The Oak Hill course has hogged praise in Meryl Streep amounts. The leader board promises weekend hyperventilation, brimming with major winners and at least one absolute, positive, definite, can’t-miss future major winner, Viktor Hovland, who stood tied for the lead at 5 under par with Scottie Scheffler and Corey Conners, among 18 players within five shots of the front, including Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy.There’s even a starring hole: No. 6.“I mean, 6 is probably the hardest hole I’ve ever played,” Scheffler said.No. 6 flirted Friday with becoming the hardest hole in PGA Championship history, surging ahead of its 17 brethren in difficulty with stats that could drop a golf-geeky jaw. By early evening, this 503-yard, par-4 barbarian had allowed three birdies, 63 pars, 63 bogeys, 24 double bogeys and three other things too profane to detail. At one point it had played to 102 over par, with second-place No. 7 at 43 over par, before that gap narrowed somewhat to 117-66 after an afternoon rainfall shooed the wind.PGA Championship leader boardFrom behind, this hole dubbed “Double Trouble” bears a sign telling how an “army of 3,000 French and Indians crossed these grounds twice in July 1687.” From the right side, it has a native area of unkempt mud and weedy reeds where Dustin Johnson visited for a penalty shot early Friday and a duck milled around with her 11 ducklings late Friday. From the left side, it has a grandstand serving the kinds of products often necessary for viewing such carnage. At the tee late Friday lay two crumpled beer cans — presumably not from players, but you never know.“I think 500 yards into the wind with water by the right and by the green, it just makes for a tough hole,” said Phil Mickelson, who will play the weekend after sneaking in on the cut line of 5 over.“It’s crazy difficult,” said Mito Pereira, the Chilean who almost won this thing last year in Tulsa and who stands six shots off the lead. Asked whether it’s fair, he said: “Today, I don’t know. I mean, it’s playing pretty long.”“The length, first of all,” said Conners, the 31-year-old Canadian in his 18th major with three top 10s, all at the Masters. “The tee shot is difficult. If you get in the rough, you have no chance to go for the green, pretty much. Even if you hit the fairway, you really can’t hit the green in two, so it’s just a hard hole.”The funny thing about that is that a sixth hole at Oak Hill once qualified for the pushover hall of fame. That happened at the 1989 U.S. Open, where the No. 6 of that time happened to be the 167-yard par 3 that staged one of the most remarkable sequences in golf history: four holes-in-one from among the first 33 players on the Friday of that event (Doug Weaver, Mark Wiebe, Jerry Pate and Nick Price). As Rick Reilly wrote in Sports Illustrated at the time: “And you know that somebody sitting at the 6th hole was seeing golf played for the first time: These guys aren’t so great. A lot of ’em don’t even make it.”And with course redesigns also art forms, the one Andrew Green fashioned here from 2015 to 2019 has gotten its nods.“I was really, really impressed” upon first sight, Conners said. “I thought it’s a spectacular test of golf. It’s demanding.”“It’s just a good, hard, fair test,” Mickelson said.“You get rewarded for good shots out here,” Scheffler said, “and if you execute, you can birdie pretty much any hole. Granted, it’s going to take two pretty incredible golf shots to do that, but it can be done.”Old Oak Hill, born in 1926 before serial makeovers all the way into its dotage, seemed to be trying hard to reward excellence as Scheffler and Conners went 67-68 while Hovland went 68-67. It had Scheffler, the 2022 Masters champion, a winner twice this year and ranked second in the world; Bryson DeChambeau, the 2020 U.S. Open champion two shots back after his gut-it-out 71 with a double bogey on No. 6 followed his opening 66; long-promising American and former Southern California Trojan Justin Suh at 3 under, two from the lead; and then more shine just below.Here came Koepka, the four-time major winner who grimaced at his own waywardness Thursday but then parred the entire front nine and birdied five times on the back nine, just about all of it with textbook accuracy for birdie putts of six, six, 11, 13 and six feet. His great 66 left him at 2 under. There stood habitual contender Justin Rose, at 1 under after his 69-70 on the par-70 track. Here came 2019 British Open winner Shane Lowry, who birdied six of the eight holes between Nos. 8 and 15 before two closing bogeys left him at even par.And writhing around back there alongside Lowry and seven others at even par, was that Rory McIlroy? That was Rory McIlroy. He birdied No. 18 from 16 feet and felt something approaching amazement.“I think how terribly I’ve felt over the golf ball over the last two days,” he said, “the fact that I’m only five back — yeah, not saying I could be up there with one of my best performances, but when I holed that putt at the last, I looked at the board, and I thought, I can’t believe I’m five back.”They all went toward a weekend forecast of rain and suspense, with only nine players under par and a course grudging in its fairness. “It’s exciting,” said Hovland, still just 25, “but you have to focus on every single shot you are hitting. Your mind can easily start to wander, and you hit a bad shot because of that, and now suddenly it’s not as exciting.”That might go double at Double Trouble.",

      "title": "Yankees Domingo Germán suspended 10 games after sticky stuff ejection",
      "text": "Major League Baseball on Wednesday suspended Yankees right-hander Domingo Germán for 10 games after he was ejected from Tuesday night’s game for using too much sticky stuff. The 30-year-old will not appeal the ban, which he will begin serving when the Yankees play the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday night.Germán held the Blue Jays scoreless and struck out two in the first three innings on Tuesday. When umpires checked his hands before the fourth, they said they found something sticky. Crew chief James Hoye later told a pool reporter that Germán’s was the “stickiest hand I’ve ever felt.” Germán later told reporters he had only used rosin.“It was not rosin,” Hoye told the pool. “I’ve felt hands with rosin and it definitely was not rosin. It was extremely sticky. Rosin is usually a little tacky. This was sticky. My fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.”Yankees starter Domingo Germán has been ejected for having an illegal substance pic.twitter.com/hq9aIPo5DXThe suspension will likely cost Germán two starts.The ejection came in the midst of a dramatic series between the American League East rivals. In Monday’s opener, cameras caught Aaron Judge looking to the side just before hitting a gargantuan homer. Toronto broadcasters speculated Judge and the Yankees might have been stealing signs. Blue Jays pitcher Jay Jackson told the Athletic on Wednesday that he was tipping pitches, meaning Judge may well have been looking for a signal for someone — like his first base coach — watching for the tip.Stealing signs like that, provided no electronics are used in the process, is legal. But the subject is sensitive. Every team is trying to pick up patterns in their opponents’ signs, but every team feigns the same offense when they are victimized.The Blue Jays’ dugout asked umpires Tuesday night to ensure Yankees third base coach Luis Rojas stayed inside his coach’s box — as if to suggest that the reason the Yankees could steal signs was because their coaches were positioned illegally. Later in the evening, the Yankees asked umpires to do the same thing with Blue Jays third base coach Luis Rivera.No evidence has surfaced to suggest that added checks on Germán were a part of the Blue Jays’ revenge plan. Germán was ejected during a routine check, not one asked for by a manager. But Germán might have been wise to exercise caution anyway: almost exactly a month ago, he found himself on the brink of a similar expulsion at the hands of the same umpire.During the third inning of a game against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, Hoye checked the righty’s hand and told him to wash it between innings. When Germán came out for the fourth inning, Hoye found some rosin remaining on his pinkie finger. He was allowed to stay in the game.“He was warned. He didn’t fully comply I would say with the warning from what I was told,” Twins Manager Rocco Baldelli told reporters after the game. “When he returned and it was still on there partially, on part of his hand, I didn’t think there was really any question he should be removed from the game.”A week later, Max Scherzer became the third player ejected under MLB’s fortified sticky stuff rules. Scherzer did not appeal his suspension, though he did lodge an informal public protest, arguing that he had only used legal substances. League rules state that while rosin is legal in its simplest form, it can be combined with other substances to reach a level of tackiness that would qualify as illegal. Just how much tackiness qualifies as illegal is up to the umpire. And a month after their first encounter, Hoye and his crew determined Germán’s hands were too sticky this time around.",

      "title": "Analysis | Did the Durham report’s criticism of juries go too far?",
      "text": "You could forgive special counsel John Durham for being a bit defensive in the final report recapping his years-long criminal probe of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether Donald Trump played a role.Tasked with investigating the investigators, Durham secured just one conviction in his three prosecutions — a guilty plea resulting in probation, in a case he was effectively handed by someone else. The two other cases resulted in unanimous jury acquittals.Despite Republican claims to the contrary, Durham’s investigation didn’t really move the needle on proving what the man who appointed him, Attorney General William P. Barr, suggested was a deliberate effort to “sabotage” Trump’s presidency. It instead rehashed much of what we already knew, and it pointed more toward “confirmation bias” by federal law enforcement than political malfeasance.But some of the ways Durham explains those shortcomings cause prosecutorial ethics experts to blanch.Somewhat akin to Trump and his allies, who have increasingly attacked the legal system, Durham points a finger at juries.Early in his report, Durham seems to suggest his probe didn’t yield more significant prosecutions and convictions because it’s difficult to find juries unbiased enough.“There are also reasons why, in examining politically-charged and high-profile issues such as these, the Office must exercise — and has exercised — special care,” Durham writes. “First, juries can bring strongly held views to the courtroom in criminal trials involving political subject matters, and those views can, in turn, affect the likelihood of obtaining a conviction, separate and apart from the strength of the actual evidence and despite a court’s best efforts to empanel a fair and impartial jury.”As Politico’s Kyle Cheney noted, this flies in the face of how the Justice Department generally talks about prosecutorial decisions. It could certainly be read as Durham blaming jurors’ “strongly held” political views for his poor record in securing convictions and, perhaps by extension, for his decision not to seek to bring additional cases.Barr offered similar comments last year while explaining the lack of convictions in the Durham probe.Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor who teaches legal ethics at New York Law School, acknowledged that the views of a potential jury can have an impact on a prosecutor’s decision on whether to bring charges.“But it is unusual and troubling for a prosecutor to publicly explain a decision not to charge in this way,” she said. “Prosecutors generally speak through indictments, court filings, statements in court, as well as press conferences explaining recent charges. There is a reason why their public comments are limited in this way.”Others indicated it might not be unethical, but that it could erode faith in the legal process.“I personally don’t think it’s unethical, but it’s rare that we have this much insight into prosecutorial decision-making,” said Kami Chavis, a former prosecutor and expert on prosecutorial discretion at William and Mary Law School. “But to me all that does is give people the opportunity to second-guess the decisions of people who we assume do their job.”Stanford University law professor Robert Gordon said this inclusion from Durham was “not unethical, but it does strike me as unseemly whining.”Later in the report, Durham addresses the two cases in which he failed to secure convictions: the Michael Sussmann case and the Igor Danchenko case. Both were indicted on charges of making false statements to the FBI.But despite juries unanimously rejecting those charges, Durham proceeds to state that both men indeed made false statements. And in the Sussmann case, in particular, he seems to maintain that his evidence was convincing that Sussmann broke the law, despite the acquittal.Of Danchenko, Durham summarizes: “In November 2021, a grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia returned an indictment  ... charging Igor Danchenko with five counts of making false statements to the FBI. The false statements, which were made during Danchenko’s time as an FBI [confidential human source], related to his role as [Christopher] Steele’s primary sub-source for the Reports.”Note the start of that second sentence: “The false statements,” rather than “alleged false statements.”Durham also suggests that the blame for the lack of a conviction lies with a judge’s decision not to admit evidence of other “uncharged false statements” by Danchenko. He details those alleged other false statements.Durham addresses the Sussmann case similarly.“Our investigation showed that, in point of fact, these representations to [FBI general counsel James] Baker were false,” he writes. And he adds later, “In connection with that second presentation, Sussmann made a similar false statement to [the CIA], claiming that he was not providing the information on behalf of any client.”Again, Sussmann was acquitted of making false statements. Perhaps Durham is arguing that these statements were false, but that they didn’t clear the legal bar for being deliberate falsehoods, or lies.But Durham elsewhere in the report suggests he still feels the evidence was there and that Sussmann cleared the bar for having made them deliberately.“Accordingly, Sussmann’s conduct supports the inference that his representations to both the FBI and the CIA that he was not there on behalf of a client reflect attempts to conceal the role of certain clients,” it says, adding: “Such evidence also further supports the inference that Sussmann’s false statements to two different agencies were not a mistake or misunderstanding but, rather, a deliberate effort to conceal the involvement of specific clients in his delivery of data and documents to the FBI and CIA.”Bennett L. Gershman, a prosecutorial ethics expert at Pace University law school, said making such statements after acquittals is wrong.“That’s highly improper for a prosecutor after a jury has acquitted you to suggest you lied,” Gershman said. “Prosecutors can’t do that, because that erodes our confidence, our trust in the system. It’s really a very dangerous thing to do.”Roiphe said that it was “particularly troubling for a prosecutor to voice confidence in an individual’s guilt after he has been acquitted or after a decision not to charge, because the accused does not have the opportunity to defend himself or rebut the allegations.”Gordon noted that the American Bar Association’s ethics code states that prosecutors should “refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.”“The use of the report to allege that Sussman and Danchenko made false statements — the very statements for which they had been charged, and acquitted of the charges — seems to me clearly unethical,” Gordon said.Former prosecutor Alafair Burke noted that Durham was in an unusual position as a special prosecutor delivering a report that other prosecutors normally wouldn’t.“In that context, his descriptions of the evidence can be read as an explanation of what he believed ex ante to support his charging decisions,” Burke said. “The risk is that partisans trying to cherry-pick the report for other purposes might read these sections as saying the jurors got it wrong and the defendants are guilty despite the verdicts.”Durham’s report comes as Trump has in recent years — and even in recent weeks — repeatedly attacked the judicial system. Trump has frequently questioned his and his supporters’ abilities to get fair hearings in heavily Democratic areas like New York City and D.C., and he has regularly invoked the idea of biased judges and juries.It’s striking enough for a former president to point in that direction; it’s almost unheard of for a powerful prosecutor.",

      "title": "A standstill settles in as Democrats fret over Feinstein’s health",
      "text": "When Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) returned to the Capitol this month, a beaming Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer was waiting for her as the gray sedan zoomed up, while a crowd of reporters and photographers looked on.Feinstein, 89, looked frail, and part of her face appeared to droop, which her office would disclose more than a week later was caused by a separate condition triggered by the shingles that had sidelined her since February. Aides helped her into a wheelchair and then quickly pushed her inside to the Senate floor, where Feinstein quietly said “aye” and cast her vote — the moment her colleagues had been waiting months for.Feinstein’s allies say that she has been doing her job since returning more than a week ago — casting votes that are needed to boost Democrats’ narrow majority in the Senate and approving President Biden’s judicial picks. But the shock of seeing Feinstein’s visibly weakened state — paired with her apparent confusion in some interactions with reporters — has created rising alarm that is rippling across both Washington and California about her fitness to serve. At the same time, there is no consensus about what should be done — and virtually no visibility into her thinking about how she will manage her duties over the next year and a half as she continues to rely on an insular circle of aides, revealing very little to the public.The standstill around the issue has been intensified by the competing interests of the three Democratic members of the House from California who are vying to replace Feinstein in the 2024 election: Adam B. Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee. All of them are allied with powerful leaders in the party who would have the ear of California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D)  were he forced to appoint a replacement for Feinstein if she stepped down before the end of her term.There were fresh questions this past week about whether Feinstein had been transparent with her constituents when it was disclosed that her case of shingles had triggered encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, as well as Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which causes facial paralysis. (A spokesperson said the encephalitis had resolved but “she continues to have complications from Ramsay Hunt syndrome.”) Before those complications were confirmed by her spokesman — only after they were reported in the New York Times — her office had not detailed any information about her medical condition beyond the shingles diagnosis and had declined requests to provide information from her doctors.Amar Shergill, chair of the Progressive Caucus of the California Democratic Party, said there is concern that the public has not gotten the full picture about the medical complications Feinstein was experiencing before she returned to Washington and alarm that she has struggled “during simple conversations with reporters about when she was working and when she wasn’t.”“Democrats are now wondering whether she’s actually capable of representing her constituents in D.C.,” said Shergill, who has endorsed Lee in the race to replace Feinstein. “This is a very important time with the impending default and the budget, and we need a senator who is involved in those discussions, and advocating in the press and taking meetings. It seems very clear that she’s not going to be able to do any of that.”But there is also no evidence of a groundswell of California groups or activists demanding that Feinstein step aside — beyond the coalition of 60 liberal grass-roots groups that urged her to resign last month. It is widely known in California Democratic circles that the senator built a career premised on her refusal to bow to pressure, with former aides and colleagues noting that the harder Feinstein is pushed, the more determined she becomes to keep her own counsel.“The pressure isn’t the thing that’s going to get her to act. It’s going to have to be a realization that she and her senior people will have to make about how sustainable this is given her abilities or lack thereof,” said California Democratic consultant Roger Salazar. “I just don’t see her leaving under anything but her own terms.”Susie Tompkins Buell, a top Democratic donor in California who admires Feinstein, said she believes many people aren’t speaking up about their concerns about her health because she seems so vulnerable and they want to be respectful. This past week, Buell told the Times she thinks Schumer or Newsom have a responsibility to do something.“I think everyone is torn between their compassion and scratching their head about practically, what they can do about this,” Buell told The Washington Post.A Feinstein spokesperson declined to comment for this article but pointed to a previous statement in which the senator said: “I’m back in Washington, voting and attending committee meetings while I recover from complications related to a shingles diagnosis. I continue to work and get results for California.”There is no indication that either Schumer or Newsom think it is their role to urge Feinstein to step aside, particularly in the midst of the contentious three-way Democratic race to replace her.Upon Feinstein’s return to the narrowly divided Senate, Schumer, who spoke to her on the phone several times during her absence, said she is “exactly where she wants to be.” Her presence solves difficult math problems for him and the White House when Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and other vulnerable Democrats up for reelection decide not to back Biden nominees.Newsom, who has known Feinstein since his earliest days in politics, would have the responsibility of appointing Feinstein’s successor if she were to leave office early — which could become one of the most consequential and politically fraught decisions he has had to make.The Democratic governor, widely viewed as a future White House contender, was under intense pressure to appoint a Black woman to the Senate when Kamala D. Harris vacated her seat to become Biden’s running mate, because her departure meant that there were no Black women serving in the chamber.Instead, he chose then-Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who became the first Latino senator from California. Newsom subsequently promised during an MSNBC interview that he would choose a Black woman if he were given another chance to make a Senate appointment.When Newsom made that promise in 2021, two natural choices were near the top of his list: then-Rep. Karen Bass, who is now mayor of Los Angeles, and Lee, who was not yet a candidate for Senate.“At that time it was just a throwaway line on cable TV to satisfy a disgruntled constituency,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches politics and communications at the University of California at Berkeley and at the University of Southern California and Pepperdine University. “Now he’s trapped by it. If he does not appoint Lee, if he does not appoint a Black woman — he angers the African American community. If he does appoint Barbara Lee, he enrages a lot of very powerful supporters of the other candidates.”While some have suggested that Newsom could choose a Black woman to fill a “caretaker” role through the end of Feinstein’s term — to avoid putting his thumb on the scale for any of the three Democrats running for the seat — several of the prominent Black female politicians who would naturally be candidates for that role have said they are not interested. And Newsom could face a backlash for overlooking Lee given that she is the longest-tenured of three candidates, the highest-ranking Black woman appointed to Democratic leadership in the House and a past chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.Aimee Allison, who founded She the People, a national network aimed at elevating the political power of women of color, noted that she was involved with the statewide network of women calling for Newsom to appoint a Black woman in 2021.Allison, who is backing Lee in the Senate race, said that although Newsom appointed Padilla, “he responded to that call publicly by making that commitment and promise, and we took him at his word.”“Many of us, including myself, find the conversation about caretaking unacceptable,” Allison added. “There was never a conversation about a caretaking role when it came to Senator Padilla. Why is there an exception for a Black woman?”Back in Washington, Feinstein’s return to the Senate has been unsteady. She has attended multiple Judiciary Committee hearings, and on Thursday, she briefly praised law enforcement as the committee passed legislation in honor of National Police Week.“There was no program more favorable with people than police on the streets,” she said of her tenure as mayor of San Francisco. “They got to know them, there was a positive relationship, the crime rate went down and I came away from the job really understanding the necessary for the juncture.”The senior California senator has also taken a handful of questions from reporters as she’s been guided to votes, occasionally sounding confused. “No, I haven’t been gone,” she told a reporter from the Los Angeles Times who asked about her colleagues’ reaction to having her back in the Senate, appearing irritated. “No, I’ve been here. I’ve been voting.”On another day, she incorrectly denied that she had suffered encephalitis during her bout of shingles, telling a CNN reporter that she had just had a “bad flu.” (Her office later clarified that Feinstein “misspoke” because her doctor had not used the medical terminology with her when describing her complications.)Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the chair of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters this past week that he could not be the judge of whether she was fit to serve and that his staff were “monitoring” her health condition on a daily basis to ensure that she could be present for votes.“She has to make that decision for herself and her family as to going forward, but we’re happy to have her back,” he said.Critics have argued that her family and friends should persuade her to resign. And former senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who said she considers Feinstein a friend, took to Twitter to say Feinstein’s “legacy is being tarnished” by her return to the Senate with such serious health issues. But Feinstein’s allies say that the senator herself pushed to return and that calls for her resignation have not deterred her.Former California governor Jerry Brown defended Feinstein in an interview with CNN on Friday, arguing that she was forced to return to the Senate because it’s unclear whether Republicans would allow a new senator to be seated on the Judiciary Committee even if she resigned. Republicans blocked Schumer’s request to temporarily replace her in April.“There’s a real challenge here that [is] exacerbated by the Republican policies,” Brown said. “Feinstein has what it takes to participate over the next several months.”It’s unclear how real that threat is, however. Committee assignments are almost universally uncontroversial measures that happen at the start of a Congress, when senators unanimously approve both Republican and Democratic assignments by a voice vote. But if someone does object to a senator’s committee assignment, that placement then needs 60 votes to be approved.Republicans argued that the earlier request was unprecedented, given that no senator appears to have been “temporarily” replaced on a committee in recent memory, and that it was even more unusual because Feinstein wanted to keep her other committee assignments. Some Republicans, including Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), said at the time that if Feinstein were replaced by a new senator, that would be a different situation and suggested it would not draw the same opposition. Democrats would likely need nine Republicans to agree to seating the new member.“There’s a huge difference between temporarily replacing a member on one of her committees for the sole purpose of advancing partisan judicial nominees and refusing to permanently sit an entirely new member on all committees,” said one Republican Senate aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal conversations.And despite the heightened scrutiny of her performance, Feinstein has faced no public pressure from Senate colleagues to resign.“We’re all human and we all have health issues, and right now she is performing as a United States senator doing her job,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told reporters this past week.Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Wizards hoping for a little magic in the NBA draft lottery",
      "text": "For the second year in a row, Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. will don a suit, climb the stage and hope for the best as he serves as Washington’s representative Tuesday in the NBA draft lottery at Chicago’s McCormick Place. The Wizards are vying for the right to draft French phenom Victor Wembanyama with just the eighth-best odds (6.7 percent) and must be crossing their fingers, hunting for four-leaf clovers, cradling fuzzy dice — whatever it takes to attract a little bit of long-overdue good luck.Drafting Wembanyama would provide a supersized injection of hope into a forlorn franchise already on the precipice of change. Washington is in the middle of a search for a new general manager and is sending Unseld onstage while assistant general manager Brett Greenberg represents the team behind the scenes in the drawing room. If they move up to win Tuesday, that top job gets a lot more enticing.First, they’ll need a heap of good karma.Which NBA lottery team needs Victor Wembanyama the most?Since the NBA began using a weighted lottery system to award the No. 1 overall pick in 1990, the team with the eighth-best odds or worse has jumped up to claim the top spot just four times. In 1993, the Orlando Magic pulled off a stunner by leaping to the top spot despite having the lowest odds to win (1.5 percent); the team drafted Chris Webber, then dealt him to the Golden State Warriors for Penny Hardaway. In 2008, the Chicago Bulls jumped from ninth (1.7 percent) to draft Derrick Rose with the No. 1 overall pick. In 2011, the Cleveland Cavaliers won the lottery with the eighth-best odds (2.8 percent), and in 2014, they moved up again, from ninth (1.7 percent), to grab the top slot and draft Andrew Wiggins (they then traded Wiggins for Kevin Love).The Wizards haven’t been as fortunate; they’ve been mired in an unfavorable streak that was extended last month when, after finishing the season 35-47, they slid to eighth place instead of seventh in the lottery when they lost a coin toss tiebreaker with the Indiana Pacers. That’s bad enough that Unseld might want to find former Cavaliers general manager and current New Orleans Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin to rub shoulders with before the drawing Tuesday night and steal some of his mojo.Washington has either stayed planted at its expected position or moved down in 18 of its 21 trips to the lottery since 1990. The worst-case scenario Tuesday is slipping to 12th, and there is a smidgen of a chance it does so — those odds are listed as just over 0.0 percent. The odds the Wizards fall to 11th are a mere 0.4 percent.The Wizards and Knicks GM Scott Perry: An ideal fit hiding in plain sightTheir last big leap was when they moved up from eighth to third to nab Otto Porter Jr. in 2013.If you’d rather turn your gaze to something sunnier, there are friendlier odds to focus on: according to Tankathon.com, the Wizards’ odds to jump into the top four are 29 percent. Though Wembanyama is a singular talent, he is one of several exciting players available in this class. Moving into the top four would put the Wizards in range to select G League Ignite point guard Scoot Henderson, Alabama forward Brandon Miller or perhaps either Amen or Ausar Thompson, the pair of identical 6-foot-7 twins who played with Overtime Elite this year.That would be fortuitous enough. The formidable gifts all of those prospects bring on court pale — at least right now, in this uncertain moment in Wizards-land — next to the hope they symbolize. If that sounds like a corny line from a superhero movie, well, Washington is in need of saving. Its roster needs are up in the air until owner Ted Leonsis hires a general manager. Kyle Kuzma will hit free agency this summer, and Kristaps Porzingis’s future with the team is uncertain because he has a player option for next season. A refreshed front office may take Washington in a new direction, or it may hunker down around Bradley Beal — or Beal could request a trade. The only thing the Wizards know they need for sure heading into Tuesday is luck.",

      "text": "More than 18 months after placing him on administrative leave during an investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Washington Commanders rehired Doug Quon to his previous role of assistant athletic trainer.Quon, who was back on the field this month during the Commanders’ rookie minicamp, started with Washington in 2014 as an assistant athletic trainer. The team placed him on leave in the fall of 2021 when the DEA investigated Washington’s former head athletic trainer, Ryan Vermillion, for the possible disbursement of prescription painkillers. In early October of that year, DEA agents and Loudoun County law enforcement officers executed search warrants at the team’s training facility in Ashburn and Vermillion’s nearby home.The team subsequently placed Vermillion on administrative leave, and 10 months later, he agreed to a deferred prosecution for illegally obtaining controlled substances and distributing them to players during his time with the team. The NFL suspended him indefinitely from working with any club, and the Commanders fired him.The team placed Quon on leave shortly after Vermillion but without clarity as was to whether the leave was tied to the investigation. He was not charged, and according to two people with knowledge of the matter, both the NFL and the NFL Players Association approved his rehiring. “Player health and safety is our top priority, and we are pleased to continue to build up our training staff with another seasoned professional with the reinstatement of Doug Quon in the role of assistant athletic trainer,” a Commanders spokesperson said in a statement. “We are happy to welcome him back.”The Commanders did not replace Vermillion or Quon during the 2021 season and instead relied on their remaining assistant athletic trainers and summer interns, as well as the temporary help of former Washington athletic trainer Bubba Tyer and former Capitals athletic trainer Greg Smith.In April 2022, the team hired Al Bellamy as head athletic trainer and later added Lindsay Gately as an assistant athletic trainer/physical therapist, making her the first full-time female member of the athletic training staff in franchise history. In 2018, Quon was a part of a Commanders’ athletic training staff that won the Ed Block Courage Award for NFL athletic training staff of the year. He was previously an assistant athletic trainer at the University of California Irvine (2013-14) and with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2012. He also interned with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2006 and 2007 and worked with Texas Tech’s football program while earning his master’s degree in athletic training.In Washington, Quon maintains the team’s database of ImPACT concussion tests with the league in addition to assisting with the daily care and rehab of players and coordinating the team’s athletic training internship.",

      "title": "DeSantis meets Sununu as he visits N.H. ahead of 2024 launch",
      "text": "CONCORD, N.H. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis met for an hour Friday with New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu — a potential rival for the GOP presidential nomination — ahead of his campaign launch as he swung through the first-in-the-nation primary state.Sununu, who is seriously considering a presidential bid and has urged the GOP to move on from Donald Trump, has also recently criticized some of DeSantis’s policy moves, including the Florida governor’s still-escalating battle with Disney, which Sununu and some other Republicans consider at odds with “free market” conservatism. But Sununu nodded to common ground with DeSantis during a brief interview Friday after their meeting.“We have a great relationship,” Sununu said in a hall of the State House. He said he meets with “everybody” as 2024 hopefuls flock to his state. Asked if he and DeSantis discussed any areas of disagreement, such as Disney, Sununu said they covered a range of topics. His spokesman, Ben Vihstadt, said they discussed strategies on how to perform well in the New Hampshire primary, among other subjects.Friday was DeSantis’s second trip this year to the Granite State. Support here could be pivotal in the governor’s efforts to pull ahead of Trump, the clear front-runner in national polling. DeSantis is expected to officially launch his campaign next week — just after his visits to New Hampshire and Iowa, another early nominating state that DeSantis’s team is focused on. He has already secured long lists of endorsements from lawmakers in both places.“What I’m concerned about is being able to fill my legislature with Republicans — and if I do not have strong winning candidates at the top of the ticket to pull all the rest of us along, we’re going to have a hard time,” said New Hampshire House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, who said DeSantis called him last week after his endorsement.He was echoing a broader argument about Trump’s electability that DeSantis and allies have made increasingly explicit. They contend the Florida governor can win the general election in swing states where Trump lost in 2020.“You have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing,” DeSantis told donors to a supportive super PAC on a call this week, according to the New York Times. “Biden, Trump and me. And I think of those three, two have a chance to get elected president — Biden and me, based on all the data in the swing states.” Representatives for DeSantis did not respond to questions about comments on the call. In recent dinners with donors, DeSantis has similarly pitched himself as more likely to win swing states, according to attendees.Sununu has also argued that Trump cannot win a general election — more bluntly and publicly. “Donald Trump is positioning himself to be a four-time loser in 2024,” he said last month on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”DeSantis, who is looking to rebound from some stumbles, is expected to start fundraising for his presidential campaign next week as donors convene in Miami.But the governor steered clear of the 2024 presidential race during his public remarks to about 30 New Hampshire lawmakers at a roundtable Friday morning. Seated next to Osborne, DeSantis got cheers for his criticisms of “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs — which he has defunded at state colleges and universities — and for his support of a Florida sales tax exemption for baby items.He leaned into retail politics, stopping to give one lawmaker’s baby a kiss before sitting down. Later, at the Red Arrow Diner — a cramped, classic campaign stop in Manchester — DeSantis talked up his policies to receptive voters, lingering for a bit with each customer as he made his way down the counter. Sometimes criticized as stiff, the governor was all smiles as he asked children questions and mentioned his family.“Four, okay, that’s a great age,” he said to one child.“That looks good — my kids would be devouring those fries, I know that,” DeSantis said later.New Hampshire Republicans noted parallels between their agenda and the bills DeSantis has passed in Florida, such as shared resistance to coronavirus restrictions.On another issue, abortion, DeSantis has gone much further than Republican leaders in New Hampshire: He recently signed into law a ban on the procedure in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy, while New Hampshire — where Republicans control state government — still allows abortions up to 24 weeks post-Roe v. Wade. But one man at the Red Arrow praised DeSantis for his handling of the issue.“Thank you for protecting babies,” the man said, reaching out to shake DeSantis’s hand across the counter.“Oh yeah, yeah, yeah — no, you can count on me,” DeSantis said.Steve Vargas said he was eager to meet DeSantis at the Red Arrow even though he comes from “more of a Trump family.” If he had to vote in the primary today, he said, he’d pick Trump. But he shares others’ worries about the former president’s ability to win reelection.Ryan Mulholland, 50, said that if Trump faces President Biden in the general election, he’ll just stay home.“He just should step aside because all he’s going to do is …. I think he would bring more controversy,” Mulholland said.",

      "title": "Perspective | Along the highways, Indian restaurants serve America’s truckers",
      "text": "About US is a forum to explore issues of race and identity in the United States. Sign up for the newsletter.VEGA, Tex. — Long before dawn on a frosty February morning in Dallas, Palwinder Singh rises from the mattress in his sleeper cab and prepares to haul his cargo cross-country. After five hours of driving north along U.S. 287, and then west on Interstate 40, it’s lunchtime.Singh, 30, pulls his semi off Exit 36 into Vega, a quiet town in the Texas Panhandle along the historic Route 66. For lunch, he bypasses the typical long-haul trucker menu of convenience-store snacks and heat-lamp hot dogs at the large Pilot Travel Center and instead rolls into the parking lot of a modest white building across the street. A sign on the building’s red roof spells out the words “Punjabi Dhaba” in the Punjabi language’s Gurmukhi script, with the English translation below it.The Vega Truck Stop and Indian Kitchen, as it’s officially known, attracts truckers like Singh originally from Punjab, a region spanning northwest India and eastern Pakistan. The store is filled with Punjabi snacks, sweets, truck decorations and a restaurant, known as a dhaba, that serves fresh meals including paratha and butter chicken — a slice of South Asia in the middle of rural Texas.That afternoon, Singh parked his truck, decorated with colorful fabrics and ornaments called jhalars and parandas. He was promptly greeted in Punjabi by another trucker, Amandeep Singh, of Fresno, Calif., who had also stopped for lunch. As they each poured a cup of steaming chai indoors, the truckers chatted about their drives.The Vega eatery is among an estimated 40 dhabas, and likely many more, that have popped up along American highways across the country in response to the growing number of Punjabi truckers, who have dominated the Indian trucking industry for decades. Punjabis now make up almost 20 percent of the U.S. trucking industry, according to Raman Dhillon, chief executive of the North American Punjabi Trucking Association. Punjabis are both truckers and owner-operators, running companies such as Tut Brothers out of Indiana and Khalsa Transportation out of California. They’re challenging the stereotype of the rugged White, male trucker that has long been associated with the industry.“The driving and the trucking is in our blood,” said Dhillon, adding that Punjabi truckers have been riding American highways since the late 1960s, especially in California. “And since then they just really swelled. For last 10 years, the Punjabi trucking industry is growing very fast and very big.”The majority of dhaba customers are part of a vast network of Punjabi truckers who share the secrets of the road through WhatsApp groups and TikToks.“There are many friends, it’s very big, there are 1,021 people in this group,” said Palwinder Singh. He said he found out about the Vega dhaba through the group and pinned it on his personal Google Maps, dotted with various dhabas around the country.“Sat Sri Akal,” the owner, Beant Sandhu, greets the truckers in Punjabi, extending his arm to shake their hands energetically and making small talk in their native language..The dhaba’s kitchen appliances whirled and hissed throughout the day, sending ripples of steam into the air as a handful of cooks rotated between julienning vegetables and sauteing them with meat and paneer in large cast-iron karahis.Sapna Devi, a cook who immigrated from Haryana — an Indian state bordering Punjab — kneaded dough into circles for mixed vegetable paratha. Harry Singh, another line cook and an immigrant, stirred yellow onions in a massive pot before scrambling paneer with it to make bhurji.Dhabas like the Vega eatery are tucked into truck stops and travel centers at the edges of sleepy American towns, some with almost all-White populations. Punjabi has seeped onto highway signs and billboards; just east of Vega is a truck and trailer sales billboard ad printed almost entirely in the language, alongside a photo of wrestling legends Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage.It’s a testament to how Punjabi drivers are changing the face of the U.S. trucking industry, the highways they traverse on a daily basis, and in turn, small-town America. And it reflects the growing influence of Punjabis — who are classified as Asians, the fastest-growing racial group in the United States — on rural America.“Punjabis have done a great deal to uplift a lot of rural America. All up and down Highway 5 through California, you have dhabas, you have gurdwaras [Sikh temples],” said Nicole Ranganath, an assistant professor of Middle East and South Asia studies at the University of California at Davis. “Rural America is much more diverse than we recognize. Punjabis have contributed a huge amount to our agricultural development and economic development and cultural diversity.”Punjabi immigrants began coming to North America in the early-20th century to work on farms and lumber mills, said Ranganath, who is also the curator of the Pioneering Punjabis Digital Archive.More recently, she said, Punjabi immigrants have been fleeing rising discrimination and violence against India’s religious minorities, including adherents of Sikhism, the majority religion in the Indian state of Punjab. Many brought farming and trucking skills with them when they emigrated from the region, primarily to California’s Central Valley to do agricultural work.Vega is home to fewer than 1,000 residents, the vast majority of them White. The town’s claim to fame is its location along the historic Route 66, which accounts for most of its seasonal tourism.The town’s only South Asian residents are the truck stop’s Punjabi owners and employees and the motel owners across the highway, who are originally from Gujarat in western India. Originally from Moga, a city in central Punjab, the dhaba’s owner, Beant Sandhu, wears a dastaar (turban) and grows out his beard in line with the Sikh tenet of kesh.“God told me to come here,” said Sandhu, leaning against a counter next to a heat-lamp display of samosas, bread pakoras and aloo patties.About 55 miles west of the Vega Truck Stop is another highway dhaba in San Jon, N.M. And about the same distance to Vega’s east is an I-40 dhaba in the town of Panhandle, Tex., just east of Amarillo — the area’s largest city. Across the state line in Oklahoma, there are more I-40 dhabas near the towns of Sayre and Cromwell. The dhabas also pepper other pockets of small-town America, including in York, Ala., Burns, Wyo., and Overton, Neb., which aren’t known for sizable Punjabi populations.The Sandhus have made a name for themselves in Vega and say the town has embraced them, despite some residents having reservations about the family when they first moved there.Sandhu and his wife  emigrated from Punjab to Northern California in the 1990s, where they joined a large Punjabi community and had three daughters. Beant Sandhu worked in various physically taxing jobs, including janitorial work. A family friend told them about how lucrative a gas station could be and connected them with an opportunity in Texas. They bought a Chevron gas station in Granbury near Dallas in 2006. Although they found the business rewarding, they wanted “something challenging, something different, something bigger,” said Arjot Sandhu, the Sandhus’ 25-year-old daughter.“If we want to get out of this, we have to take the risk,” the family thought, according to Arjot, who said her parents uprooted their lives in California to move the family to Texas. “All we had was a pickup truck and our stuff, and then we came straight to Texas.”In 2018, the Sandhus started a truck stop in Vega. At first they stocked the convenience store with typical American snack fare: potato chips, soft drinks and candy. But they soon discovered that the trucking demographic is “actually more Indian,” said Arjot, than the family had initially thought, and a friend told them about the concept of dhabas along major U.S. highways. As they began to see more Indian customers come in, they started asking them what they’d like to see in the store.The family began importing groceries from India. “[The dhaba] started growing from word to word, mouth-to-mouth,” said Arjot, who helps her family out at the dhaba, sometimes driving five hours from the Dallas-Fort Worth area on weekends after finishing her classes for the week.The Vega dhaba is now combed into neat rows of Indian snacks, sweets and spices: Punjabi biscuits flecked with carom seeds, packets of whole cardamom and cloves, and bright blue bags of India’s Magic Masala-flavored, crinkle-cut Lay’s potato chips abound. The convenience store also sells truck ornaments with images of Guru Nanak, Sikhism’s founder, among other items.In February, the Vega Truck Stop seldom saw a dull moment, with truckers trickling through in a steady stream beginning in  late morning into the nighttime. The drivers rolled out of their trucks in comfortable clothing. Jovneek Smith, one of few women in the industry, wore a tracksuit with slippers, and Mohamed Muhudin wore shorts and a T-shirt. Muhudin is part of a growing population of Somali truckers who also patronize the dhaba because Punjabi food has similarities to Somali food, they say.When the coronavirus pandemic erupted in 2020, the Sandhus, who had previously commuted between the Dallas area and Vega, moved to Vega full time to run the dhaba. Arjot’s younger sisters enrolled in the local schools while she took online classes during her last semester of college. The family adjusted the dhaba’s hours, reducing employees’ schedules and limiting the menu to popular items. Still, they feared their reduced staff couldn’t keep up with demand and that the dhaba wouldn’t make it.“There were days where we cried so much because there’s orders of like 50 or 60 roti and we have zero made,” Arjot said. “There were days where we’d get so burned out.”Despite the challenges of the pandemic, business has improved, and the family is hopeful about the dhaba’s future, although they are mindful that their business relies heavily on the conditions of seasonal highway traffic and the trucking industry.“Whatever they go through, we go through,” Arjot said. “Right now, Punjabi truckers are suffering as they’re not getting the rates they desire or actually need.” Indeed, members of the North American trucking industry have recently threatened strikes over tense contract negotiations.The family plans to renovate their dhaba this summer, adding showers and gas pumps. These improvements, Arjot  said, will help develop the dhaba into a full-service travel center for not only truckers, but also for interstate travelers and local residents.The Sandhus hope that their renovated dhaba will serve as a model for others, slowly and collectively becoming a staple of the American highway. For her part, Arjot  can already envision Punjabi dhabas joining the ranks of big-box truck stops and travel centers peppering motorways.“It’s just like how you’d go to a Pilot,” she said, “but it’ll be the Punjabi dhaba.”",

      "title": "Corey Dickerson’s welcome-back HR not enough for Nats in loss to Marlins",
      "text": "MIAMI — Corey Dickerson had waited over a month to return to the Washington Nationals’ lineup. When he finally stepped to the plate, he didn’t waste any time.The 33-year-old slugger squared up the second pitch he saw from Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera in the second inning and launched it into the second deck at LoanDepot Park for a two-run homer. The blast came in his first at-bat since April 1, when he strained his calf and subsequently went on the injured list the following day.Dickerson finished 2 for 4 with a pair of runs scored, providing much of the offense for the Nationals in a 4-3 loss.“It felt like Opening Day for me,” Dickerson said. “To get the first hit, first homer out of the way was pretty cool. But it all goes to the training staff who did such a good job getting me back. They really cared and put in the effort and time and I’m pretty appreciative to them. Nationals Manager Dave Martinez wanted to bring in a left-handed outfielder last offseason who could provide pop in the middle of the order. The Nationals eventually signed Dickerson to a one-year, $2.25 million deal in January.But Dickerson’s hasty trip to the IL left a void in the order. Washington recalled Stone Garrett, leaving Martinez with four right-handed hitters and limited platoon options. Meanwhile, Dickerson traveled with the team while rehabbing, and as the Nationals struggled to hit for power, his absence somehow felt more pronounced.Joey Meneses — the team’s primary designated hitter — has two home runs. Jeimer Candelario and Dominic Smith have four and one respectively. As a team, Washington entered Wednesday 29th in the majors in homers (27) and 28th in slugging (.367). So Dickerson’s blast was a welcome sight.“It was awesome,” Martinez said of the homer. “He’s waited a long time to get back in the lineup. It’s good to see that he’s healthy and he’s going to help us.”Dickerson gave an early lead to MacKenzie Gore, who was unable to hold it. Gore was more efficient against the Marlins compared with his previous outing, throwing 60 of 93 pitches for strikes. He got seven whiffs on 10 swings against his curveball.Gore allowed a run in the second inning on a sacrifice fly by Yuli Gurriel, then became the latest Nationals pitcher victimized by Jorge Soler, who blasted a two-run homer a night after lifting the Marlins to a walk-off win Tuesday with a two-run shot off Hunter Harvey. Gore wanted to pitch inside, but he missed his location.“That’s the one guy that we can’t let beat us going in,” Gore said about Soler. “And I threw a pitch right down the middle. So it’s frustrating for that reason, but the stuff was fine.”Gore’s outing was over after he allowed an RBI double to Bryan De La Cruz in the sixth inning to give Miami a 4-2 lead. His line included seven strikeouts and two walks.Dickerson sparked a rally when he singled to open the seventh and Ildemaro Vargas followed with the same; both advanced 90 feet on a throwing error by Jon Berti. Alex Call drove in Dickerson with a groundout, but CJ Abrams and Lane Thomas struck out swinging, leaving Vargas at second.Dickerson had one more chance to play hero with the Nationals trailing by one run and Candelario on first in the ninth. But he hit into a fielder’s choice before Vargas bounced into a game-ending double play.The Nationals’ issues Wednesday were easy to trace — they struck out nine times and went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position. And outside of Dickerson’s homer, they only had one extra-base hit.“We were really close,” Dickerson said. “You’re always disappointed when you get out in the last outing. … As a player, we have short memories. … You compete and you hate when you lose. So you look forward to the next time.”The Nationals placed Meneses on paternity leave before Wednesday’s game and recalled infielder Jake Alu from Class AAA Rochester. Meneses’s fiancee gave birth to their son, Joseph, according to the player’s Instagram. Meneses is eligible to return to the active roster Saturday.Alu, 26, arrived in time for first pitch. He had been demoted Monday afternoon when Dickerson returned from the injured list. Alu made his major league debut May 9 and picked up his first hit against the Mets on Friday.Aníbal Sánchez threw out the ceremonial first pitch at LoanDepot Park on Wednesday after announcing his retirement a day earlier. Sánchez, 39, pitched 16 years in the majors and spent time with the Marlins, Detroit Tigers and Atlanta Braves before his final stop with the Nationals.Sánchez pitched his final three seasons in Washington, taking a year off in 2021 before returning in 2022. His finest performance for Washington came when he tossed 7⅔ no-hit innings in Game 1 of the 2019 NLCS against the Cardinals en route to a World Series title. Sánchez said he will spend more time with family in retirement, though he didn’t rule out eventually coaching.",

And yellow cake is far and away the most popular flavor, with chocolate at second. Many of us just grab the first box we spy at the grocery store, since it’s impossible from the packaging to know which is going to give us the best results. So to determine the mix we should seek out and those to leave behind, we set out to test the field.To figure out which brands readers are most likely to encounter, we culled a list of the top-selling brands of prepared cake, cupcake and pie mixes from the Chicago-based market research firm IRI (its numbers came from grocery, drug, mass-market, convenience, military, and select club and dollar retailers, and covered the year that ended in January.). We bought yellow cake mix from the brands that offered it to get a total of 10 boxed mixes (private-label brands were No. 5 on the list, so we picked up a few popular grocery-store brands).6 baking myths that you shouldn't believeFor each, we baked the 9-by-13 version, strictly adhering to the directions on each box (for the few that didn’t offer such instructions, we made 9-inch rounds, as directed). Things got off to a not-so-sweet start when the first few cakes came out surprisingly dark brown and leathery. We swapped the nonstick pans we’d been using for standard aluminum ones, and started over — but let this be a lesson about the difference bakeware can make! Only one of these major brands specifies a lower baking temperature for nonstick.Our eight brave volunteers tasted all 10 samples in a side-by-side, blind test (that is, they didn’t know which brands were which), awarding each up to a score of 10, taking into account appearance, flavor and texture. We gave each panelist a bowl of vanilla buttercream frosting to spread on top, to get the most accurate read on how each cake would perform in the wild.And something really interesting (and unprecedented for us!) happened: There was a tie for the No. 1 slot. Now, we’ve had ties in previous taste tests, but only for runner-up positions, never for the winner. We really wanted to give our readers a clear overall recommendation, so we took the rare step of conducting a runoff contest (insert election joke here). For this round, we pitted the top two cakes against one another and assembled a fresh panel of five tasters. This process almost resulted in another tie — and if it had, we probably would have just thrown in our floury dish towel and declared the two brands to be co-champions. But the winning cake mix beat the runner-up by a single point. So we have a winner, and also a very solid contender. (That bonus round explains the disparity in scoring; the top two on the list had a potential additional 50 points to pick up in the final battle.)That’s enough about the methodology — like many an attendee of an office party, you’re probably just here for the cake. And so, without further ado, here’s how those boxes stacked up:Score: 17The bottom two scorers in this taste test happen to be the two gluten-free mixes of the bunch. The Krusteaz sample in particular got dinged for an unappealingly pale hue, which several people likened to banana bread. Its worse-than-dense texture was labeled “firm,” “mealy,” with “no give.” “It’s a brick,” one taster concluded. “Dry, mealy and tough at the same time,” said another. (Price: $4.58 / 18 ounces at Walmart)Score: 22Another gluten-free brand, another wanly colored cake. This one reminded four tasters of cornbread, and that wasn’t a good thing. Unlike the Krusteaz, the Birch Benders didn’t suffer from being too dry, but that didn’t mean tasters liked it, either. “Is it underbaked?” one wondered. “Wet?” asked another. One deemed it “almost flavorless,” while several pegged it as some kind of healthier formula. “Is this an everything-free recipe?” one asked. (Price: $8.99 / 10.9 ounces at Giant)Score: 34Several tasters appreciated the uniform, finely crumbed, “spongy sponge” texture. But you can’t get by on looks alone, and the flavor fell far short. “This tastes like pressed wood chips,” said one unimpressed taster. “Not much taste,” said another.And not that this is something the tasters knew (remember, it was a blind test), but this one had the most streamlined preparation of the bunch: The box called for just egg and water, as opposed to most of the rest that also required the addition of oil or butter or milk. But its old-school packaging and sizing meant that one package resulted in either an 8- or 9-inch round or an 8-inch square, as opposed to most of the rest, which produce a convenient sheet-pan size. (Price: $1.19 / 9 ounces at Publix)Score: 36From the company that makes products beloved by many a home baker, this mix was the most labor-intensive of the bunch (it called for adding butter, oil, eggs and milk, unlike the other mixes, which typically called for only two of those). Several tasters deemed it to be the thickest of the samples, with a tight crumb and a dense interior. Some found that unappealing (“I had to put effort in getting my fork through it!” “Too dense, too dry”), but a couple noted that those qualities might be stabilizing assets in a stacked layer cake. And the brand’s boast that it contains no artificial colors or flavors translated to our tasters as a bland, “modest” hint of vanilla. (Price: $7.49 / 40 ounces at BJ’s Wholesale Club)Score: 37Our panel found that the Whole Foods’ house-brand mix produced a decidedly middle-of-the-road confection. Reviews were the equivalent of yawns. “Inoffensive,” remarked one. Many liked its “glossy” brown top but otherwise found little to single out about this humdrum slice. (Price: $3.29 / 16 ounces at Whole Foods)Score: 41Products from the quirky grocery chain often end up attaining cult status, but alas, TJ’s cake mix does not seem destined to rise to that pantheon. Several testers noted that it fell flat — literally. “Sadly short,” said one. “I can’t imagine how unimpressive a finished cake would be.” (Price: $2.99 / 16 ounces at Trader Joe’s)Score: 44America’s uncontested top-selling brand didn’t wind up being our favorite. But it had some things going for it: Our testers noted it was one of the loftiest entrants (“You could make a tall layer cake with this,” one surmised). And it clearly struck some nostalgic notes. “Would definitely eat and feel like a kid again,” another said. But one detected a “slight metallic” note, and another said it was more redolent of generically sweet “birthday cake” than natural vanilla. (Price: $2.39 / 15.2 ounces at Giant)Score: 58You wouldn’t go wrong with this popular mix, which pleased our panel for its familiar vibe and “moist” consistency. But it didn’t wow most of our panel. “Basic yellow cake,” said one. “Standard ‘yellow’ flavor,” said another. It had its fans, though: One taster declared it her runaway favorite (“I feel the sugar high coming on, just give me a piñata to hit!”), and even took the remainder of her sample with her for a snack later. (Price: $2.89 / 15.25 ounces at Safeway)Score: 100 (61 in first round, 39 in runoff)Several tasters praised the pleasantly “fluffy” consistency and eye-catching butter-yellow hue of this one. “Nice and plush,” said another. And it contained just the right amount of sugar, our panel agreed: “Good cake flavor but not so sweet it hurts,” in the words of one fan. “Tastes like childhood birthday parties,” said one. Another suggested it might be the one cake in the taste test that she could credibly pass off as homemade (we won’t tell!).The Duncan Hines cake tied for first in our initial tasting, and so it went mano a mano with the other top pick. But in the final round, some detected just the slightest aftertaste (“A little eggy?” one wondered) and found it a touch more subtly flavored than the ultimate winner. For many people, though, this might just be the best option, since — unlike our winner — it’s available at most grocery stores. (Price: $1.69 / 15.25 ounces at Food Lion)Score: 101 (61 in first round, 40 in runoff)Need to whip up a birthday cake in a hurry? According to our panel, Walmart’s house brand is your best bet for a dessert that will please a crowd with a sunshiny color, pronounced vanilla flavor and a not-too-dense, not-too-airy consistency that even the pickiest Goldilocks would want to invite to her party. (And not for nothing — it’s the cheapest option we tested.)“Would absolutely serve this,” said one discerning entertainer. Another noted that it had a smooth surface, optimal for icing. “Delish!” said one taster. “What more could a girl want?” (Price: 89 cents / 15.25 ounces at Walmart)",

      "title": "The NFL says owners will not vote next week on the Commanders sale",
      "text": "NFL team owners will not vote on the prospective approval of Josh Harris’s $6.05 billion deal to purchase the Washington Commanders from Daniel Snyder at their meeting next week, the league said Thursday.“There will be an update for the membership on the purchase and sale agreement that we saw last week, I guess it was Friday,” Jeff Miller, the league’s executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy, said in a video news conference. “There are not going to be any votes at this time. League staff and the finance committee will continue to review the details of the transaction, as they would in the normal course.”The NFL finance committee has raised issues about the structure of Harris’s deal. The committee considers the deal to be well above the NFL’s $1.1 billion debt limit for a franchise purchase, one person familiar with its deliberations said this week. The Harris group believes that the deal is in compliance with all NFL ownership rules, people with knowledge of the sales process have said. The deal is vetted by the eight-owner finance committee, which then makes a recommendation to the owners. The sale must be approved by a vote of at least 24 of the 32 owners; they generally follow the recommendation of the committee. The owners meet Monday and Tuesday in Minneapolis at their regularly scheduled quarterly meeting. The NFL did not provide a timetable Thursday for a possible ratification vote.“The transaction was just submitted to the league,” Miller said. “The purchase and sale agreement was just agreed upon, I guess, Friday. So there’s work that goes into that. As I mentioned, staff is doing that work now [and will] present that to the finance committee in the normal course. And after that, there will be a vote, I would imagine, of the full membership. So [there’s] nothing special or out of the ordinary. [It’s an] ordinary process, as we would for any other transaction of its sort.”The owners’ next scheduled meeting, after next week’s, is in October. The NFL could schedule a special meeting for the owners to vote on the Commanders sale, as it did last August when the owners approved Rob Walton’s $4.65 billion purchase of the Denver Broncos.“I don’t really know how to compare it against other transactions,” Miller said. “But the process is the same. We have staff working on it. Any transaction like this is important. It deserves due process. We will certainly go through it and do it as expeditiously as we can. Since the parties have an agreement, that’s our responsibility. Our responsibility is to share it with the finance committee and for them to understand it before we go to the full membership.”NFL finance committee has concerns about Josh Harris’s Commanders dealPeople familiar with the NFL’s inner workings and the views of the owners have said the owners would like to make the deal with Harris work to remove Snyder from the league’s ownership ranks with as little additional rancor as possible. But the finance committee must be convinced that the deal complies with the debt limit, they say, requiring further work with the Harris group on the structure.The then-tentative deal was submitted to the league for an informal review last month even before it became signed and exclusive last Friday, although two people connected to the process said Thursday the final version of the sale agreement contained significant changes from the tentative deal.The NFL also is in conversations with Snyder’s representatives, people familiar with those discussions have said, about issues related to indemnification and the league’s investigation of Snyder and the team being conducted by attorney Mary Jo White. The NFL reiterated Thursday that it will release the findings of White’s investigation publicly.“Nothing has changed there,” Miller said. “Once she completes her review, we’ll release the findings of it, as we’ve said for some period of time. And [there’s] no other news to report there.”",

      "title": "Analysis | The other problem with having a Proud Boys sympathizer in the D.C. police",
      "text": "The indictment of a D.C. police lieutenant on Thursday is, at a minimum, disconcerting. Beyond the indictment itself, the case reflects a serious challenge for American law enforcement.What’s alleged — and will, at some point presumably, need to be proved in court — is that Shane Lamond, who led the Metropolitan Police Department’s intelligence branch, was in regular communication with Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, including in the period during and after the 2020 presidential election. According to messages presented in the indictment, the relationship was not confined to intelligence gathering on Lamond’s part and, instead, included his actively assisting the Proud Boys leader.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpBy now, you’ve probably heard of the Proud Boys. It’s a fringe-right group that espouses the primacy of “Western civilization” — an unsubtle coding for White culture — and that embraces violence. During 2020, its efforts became “strongly correlated with the fortunes of former President Trump,” according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. That included protests in D.C. in November and December that were followed by street brawls involving Proud Boys members.“I can’t say it officially, but personally I support you all and don’t want to see your group’s name or reputation dragged through the mud,” Lamond allegedly wrote to Tarrio at one point in a private message on Telegram. That message was sent on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the riot at the Capitol that injured scores of police officers, including some from the D.C. department, and after it was obvious that the Proud Boys played a role in the day’s violence.This could be framed as Lamond trying to work his source, and perhaps it will be at trial. The Washington Post couldn’t immediately reach Lamond’s attorney on Friday, but the lawyer has said in the past that his client’s contacts with Tarrio were part of his work to gather intelligence and prevent clashes.There are, however, indications that the police officer was actually reflecting his sincere belief.On Nov. 7, 2020, the day the election was called for Joe Biden, Lamond allegedly contacted Tarrio.“Hey brother,” he wrote, according to the indictment, “sad, sad news today. You all planning anything?”Tarrio allegedly replied, “Yep.”An hour later, prosecutors allege that Lamond sent Tarrio a warning.“Need to switch to encrypted,” Lamond allegedly wrote. “Alerts are being sent out to [law enforcement] that [social media] accounts belonging to your people are talking about mobilizing and ‘taking back the country.’”If this is accurate, Lamond isn’t gathering intelligence. Quite the opposite: He’s telling Tarrio that the Proud Boys should use encrypted tools to shield their communications — their planning — from law enforcement eyes. He and Tarrio allegedly used the encrypted messaging tool on Telegram to chat. The indictment claims that at least 100 messages between Tarrio and Lamond that only they would have seen were destroyed. Those messages were sent between Dec. 18, 2020 — after Tarrio and the Proud Boys engaged in street brawls in D.C. after a pro-Trump rally — and Jan. 4, 2021.On that day, Tarrio was arrested for burning a Black Lives Matter (BLM) banner seized from a D.C. church. The Lamond indictment alleges that the police officer attempted to obstruct justice by feeding information about the arrest to Tarrio.This is one officer allegedly engaged in sympathetic behavior with a violent right-wing group. But it falls into a national conversation in which the political allegiances and behavior of law enforcement officers are under increased scrutiny and undergirding a partisan divide on views of police.By April 2021, ABC News had documented more than 50 arrests of Capitol riot participants who were active or retired members of the military, government or law enforcement. This week, NBC News reported, the FBI stripped the security clearance of an FBI agent who was present at the Capitol that day and was found to have “expressed support for the protestors’ unauthorized entry into the Capitol building and support for their criminal acts against the U.S.”The riot followed months of Trump leveraging and exacerbating tensions between police and BLM protesters who took to the streets in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Trump tried repeatedly to position police officers as his political allies, both subtly and unsubtly. At times, the support he offered police was reciprocated.Partisan tensions over the police aren’t new, but they spiked after the emergence of BLM nearly a decade ago. The movement’s effort to draw attention to systemic problems within law enforcement, embraced by the political left, triggered a strongly pro-police response on the right.In 2012, about a quarter of Democrats said they had a “great deal” of confidence in the police, according to Gallup, compared with more than a third of Republicans. That 11-point gap became a 38-point gap by 2021, with only 1 in 10 Democrats having a great deal of confidence and half of Republicans holding that position.Republicans were 2½ times as likely as Democrats to say they viewed the police with a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in 2021.This is not like the decrease in confidence that Gallup has recorded for other institutions. It is more important that Americans have confidence in the objectivity of the police than, say, large technology companies. Police departments ideally derive their authority from public trust and accountability to elected officials. In Gallup’s polling during the 2000s, an average of 59 percent of Americans had a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the police. So far this decade, the average is 48 percent.Race sits at the root of this shift. BLM identified systemic problems to draw attention to the fact that Black Americans are disproportionately likely to be killed by police. “Black Lives Matter” was countered with “Blue Lives Matter,” explicitly positioning “blue” — police — against Black. That Democrats are much more skeptical of police is certainly in some part because Black Americans are so disproportionately members of that party.One of the tips that Lamond allegedly gave Tarrio revealed his thoughts on this point, too. Tarrio was apparently concerned that burning the BLM banner would result in hate-crime charges. Lamond told the Proud Boys leader that he had argued against that.“They wanted to know what I know about your group and if I think you all are racist,” Lamond allegedly wrote to Tarrio in an encrypted chat on Dec. 18, 2020. “I told them you are made up of a lot of Latinos and [B]lacks so not a racist thing.” (This is not itself necessarily a fair conclusion.)“If anything I said it’s political but then I drew attention to the Trump and American flags that were taken by antifa,” the message reportedly continued. “I said all those would have to be classified as hate crimes too.”That Lamond wrote these messages is an unproven allegation from federal law enforcement. They may at some point be credibly explained as part of an effort by Lamond to ingratiate himself with Tarrio. Or they may reinforce a concern that critics on the left have of police: that even senior police officials may have so poor an understanding of discrimination and racism that they think burning a BLM banner and burning an American flag constitute the same sort of “hate.”Not to mention that a senior official would express sympathy with and approval for right-wing extremists who repeatedly engaged in political violence in the city he was sworn to protect.",

      "title": "Analysis | The revenge of Chris Christie? How he could take it to Trump.",
      "text": "Say what you will about Chris Christie; he is a smart man. He’s an accomplished former U.S. attorney and someone who, for a time at least, harnessed the political zeitgeist to become a popular governor and a supposed savior-in-waiting for the GOP in 2012.He must know that he has precious little chance in 2024.A December poll showed just 3 percent of Republican-leaning voters said they would be “very satisfied” with him as their nominee. A more recent poll showed fully 70 percent wouldn’t even consider him (the most of nine candidates tested). Even in New Hampshire, the state he would apparently focus heavily on, a recent poll showed primary voters disliked him 53 percent to 10 percent.Yet signs are building that Christie will again decide to run for president at what is decidedly the wrong time — even more than 2016 was. And while he has insisted this isn’t just a kamikaze mission to take down Donald Trump, it’s difficult to see how it could amount to much else.Despite Christie’s insistence, there is no question that he has motivation to go there, that he’s demonstrated a talent for going there, and that he increasingly is going there.Christie, perhaps more than any other Republican politician, has a relationship with Trump containing multitudes. While Trump has a talent for making people regret their loyalty to him, Christie might be at the top of that list.He was a staunch Trump critic in the 2016 primaries before his early endorsement was really the first big one to lend Trump mainstream credibility. Then Trump rather quickly subjected him to a series of indignities: the endorsement news conference, the apparent jab at Christie’s weight, the allusion to Christie’s travails as governor of New Jersey.Christie lobbied harder than anyone to become Trump’s vice-presidential pick, but he was passed over in a way that seemed to surprise him. Then Christie took over Trump’s 2016 transition team, before being quickly pushed aside. Trump declined on multiple occasions to make him attorney general, the cabinet job Christie was most suited for, leading Christie to explain in early 2019, “He hasn’t offered me anything that I really wanted to do.”It was at this point that the cracks in their alliance began to form, and they became chasms after Jan. 6, 2021. Christie has even blamed Trump for giving him a coronavirus infection that landed him in intensive care in late 2020, and he said Trump never called to check on him.But even those criticisms pale in comparison to what Christie is unleashing today. While other 2024 hopefuls avoid criticizing the man they’re trying to usurp for fear of alienating his base — witness what just happened with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) super PAC when it sent out a tweet attacking Trump’s CNN town hall comments — Christie is characteristically far less shy.Just last week, Christie called Trump “a puppet of Putin.” He’s targeted Trump over being found liable for sexual assault in the E. Jean Carroll case. He has knocked Trump for being “afraid” of debates. And unlike others, he’s lent credibility to his comments by saying he would never back Trump again.Despite his heavy criticism of Trump, Christie sought to assure political watchers last month that it wouldn’t just be about that — that he needed to see a path to victory.“I’m not a paid assassin,” he told Politico, adding, “When you’re waking up for your 45th morning at the Hilton Garden Inn in Manchester, you better think you can win, because that walk from the bed to the shower, if you don’t think you can win, it’s hard.”But that’s not mutually exclusive. Christie can still make his campaign about Trump, which he has signaled he’s inclined to do. Virtually all of his commentary in recent weeks has focused like a laser on going at Trump, which Christie suggests he sees as his path to victory.“Tonight is the beginning of the case against Donald Trump,” Christie said last month during an event in New Hampshire.He continued: “You’re not going to beat someone by closing your eyes, clicking your heels together three times and saying, ‘There’s no place like home.’ That’s not going to work. In American politics, you want to beat somebody? You have to go get them.”Indeed, Christie seems prepared to be the one to test the theory, common in Trump-critic circles, that Republicans need to actually go at Trump if they’re to have any chance of defeating him. The problem with that, similar to the GOP’s approach to Trump for years, is that nobody wants to be the one to leap and make that case. Better to let someone else torpedo themselves in the process. And then nobody does.Notably, Christie’s probably best situated to do it. While Never Trumpers love Liz Cheney, and Asa Hutchinson and Chris Sununu appear ready to make such a case, Christie actually has a track record here that suggests it could matter.You might recall perhaps the most significant debate moment of 2016 came in February, when Christie played a major role in ending what remained of Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) chances by casting a harsh spotlight on Rubio’s robotic answers. Would Rubio have beaten Trump? Probably not. Will it be as easy to embarrass Trump like that? No. But Christie is uniquely situated to try.And Christie suggests he sees exactly that as his calling.“You better have somebody on that stage who can do to him what I did to Marco,” Christie said in late March, “because that’s the only thing that’s gonna defeat Donald Trump.”Christie’s standing in the polls back then in 2016? The low single digits. He had finished 10th in Iowa, and his campaign was basically over, but he did it anyway.",

      "title": "George Santos, under indictment, lists new campaign treasurer: George Santos",
      "text": "Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was charged earlier this month with a host of financial crimes, is now serving as the treasurer for his own campaign and several affiliated committees, according to filings made Friday by the committees with the Federal Election Commission.The congressman’s unusual move to become his own campaign treasurer followed his indictment on 13 counts of financial crimes last week by federal prosecutors in New York. His colleagues also referred a resolution to the House Ethics Committee this week to expel him from Congress. Santos, 34, has vowed not to resign, maintaining that he will prove his innocence and seek reelection next year.The embattled congressman cycled through numerous treasurers in recent months as his campaign’s finances came under scrutiny, at one point listing someone who later denied having agreed to take the role. The treasurer identified on his filings until Friday’s amendments, Andrew Olson, did not respond to a request for comment.The change was a reminder of Santos’s growing isolation. It came as the law firm assisting the New York congressman with matters before the FEC and the House Ethics Committee dropped him as a client, according to people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. During the last election cycle, his main campaign committee paid that firm, Dickinson Wright, about $40,000 for consulting and compliance services, according to filings.A Dickinson Wright spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Santos did not respond to a text message seeking comment. The congressman’s communications director resigned this week.People familiar with the situation said they were unsure how Santos would handle matters before the FEC or House Ethics without counsel. He has a separate attorney representing him in the federal criminal case in the Eastern District of New York, who also did not respond to a request for comment.Wide-ranging complaints filed by watchdog groups with the FEC earlier this year accused Santos of misrepresenting campaign spending and using campaign resources to cover personal expenses, among other allegations. In January, the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section asked the FEC to hold off on any enforcement action against Santos, suggesting that prosecutors were examining overlapping issues.Last week’s indictment accused Santos of misappropriating donor money for his personal gain and lying on personal financial disclosure forms submitted to Congress, among other alleged misdeeds. Inconsistencies with his campaign’s filings to the FEC did not figure in the charges, though legal experts said prosecutors could level additional allegations as the case proceeds.Meanwhile, FEC analysts have continued to inquire with his various committees about errors and oversights in filings. Answering those requests will now fall to Santos as treasurer.",

      "title": "She had lived a life of adventure. Then came the ultimate sailing race.",
      "text": "Crimson flares dyed the evening sky a blazing red as Kirsten Neuschafer guided her sailboat into the French port of Les Sables-d’Olonne on April 27. Eight months earlier, she had left this harbor as the lone woman in a 16-entrant, around-the-world race in which solo competitors were required to use 54-year-old technology and prohibited from making stops.During 235 days at sea, Neuschafer had only a vague knowledge of her place in the standings of the Golden Globe Race. When told by event organizers that she had won, all she could do was stare in surprise and blurt, “Really?”Since leaving her family farm outside Pretoria, South Africa, as a teenager, Neuschafer, 41, has led a life of endless adventure: hitchhiking on ships to the Arctic, training huskies in the icy wilderness, bicycling across Africa and leading sailing expeditions to the bottom of the globe. But she had never done anything quite like the Golden Globe Race. Very few have.This was only the second Golden Globe Race since it was revived in 2018 as a replica of the famous 1968 venture by the same name during which nine men attempted to circle the planet in sailboats. (Only one completed the circuit, and another was declared dead by suicide.) It’s less a competition and more a fight to keep mind and boat intact while sailing with only instruments and communication devices available in 1968.Following the course that headed south after leaving France, before heading east to sail past the southern tip of Africa and continuing south of Australia and South America and finally turning back north to return, competitors paused at just four designated spots to check in with race officials in nearby boats. Even then, the sailors aren’t allowed to leave their boats and can’t take on supplies, relying instead on whatever they packed before the trip. Aside from satellite phones used for emergencies, they are essentially on their own.“These people are f------ crazy,” Neuschafer’s friend Alicia Biggart said.When Neuschafer first heard about the Golden Globe Race in 2019, her first thought was “that it seems kind of cool.” But that was before she set off last Sept. 4 in a 36-foot boat she helped rebuild.Her friends worried she would return feral with wild eyes and ragged hair. Instead, she glowed in her fiery welcome at the finish line tooting a small plastic vuvuzela and seemed very much like a woman at peace.“It was actually nine out of 10 times quite enjoyable,” she said by phone from Les Sables-d’Olonne, where she has been recovering from the trip. “I really enjoyed the last few months being one with the ocean.”Neuschafer’s friends have long been amazed by her ability to spend weeks alone on her many excursions and then return as happy as when she left. They love her curiosity. They are amazed at her fluency in English, Afrikaans, German and French and deep understanding of several more languages, including some they had never heard of. Mostly, though, they are dazzled by her stories of adventure, most of which have to be solicited because she never brings them up herself.Such as how, at 19, while on a visit to Finland, she was struck by a desire to see the Arctic and went around the local port offering to peel potatoes in exchange for a ride north.Or how she stayed for two years in northern Finland, working as a wilderness guide, carrying a gun in case a polar bear pushed its way into her tent.Or how, at 22, while traveling in Portugal, she decided to bicycle home to South Africa, crossing from Spain to Morocco by ferry and cycling down back roads with little more than a small tent, a water purifier, a portable stove and a pocket knife.Or how people in the remote villages along the way rushed to see her, intrigued, she said, “by the White woman bicycling across Africa.” Or how in one particularly hidden part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, she contracted malaria and slept for three weeks in a hut with a family whose father, on the day she left, called her “my White daughter.”Or how she spent the next several years working for a sailboat charter company, leading film crews on wildlife excursions around South Georgia Island and Antarctica.“She’s just very uplifting,” said Erin Ranney, a photographer and videographer who spent a month with Neuschafer on one of those trips. “She would walk me through so many things and help me to realize I could do them.”Neuschafer first heard of the Golden Globe Race in 2019, when she took one of the charter company’s boats to Maine for repairs. She initially hesitated about entering. She didn’t own a boat, and the cost of buying and preparing one for such an ordeal would be more than $300,000. She wasn’t independently wealthy like many of the Golden Globe Race entrants who sent their boats to expensive repair yards to be refitted.It took urging from a group of friends in Maine, including Biggart, who offered to help her find sponsors and donors before Neuschafer finally signed up. She spent weeks looking for the right boat, falling in love with a Cape George Cutter 36 in Newfoundland named Minnehaha, after the wife of the Native American adventurer Hiawatha in the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, “The Song of Hiawatha.”The name seemed to fit. She bought Minnehaha in late 2020 and hoped to sail somewhere warm to begin the restoration when winter weather forced her to stop on the north shore of Prince Edward Island in January 2021. Trapped there as the harbor froze over, her friend network put her in touch with Eddie Arsenault, a local boat builder, who pulled Minnehaha from the water and took her by lobster boat trailer to a repair garage on his property.Neuschafer told Arsenault about her around-the-world race. He told her it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and said he would help her refurbish Minnehaha.“She had a long list of things to do,” Arsenault said. “But soon it doubled and tripled.”They installed new deck flooring and strengthened the mast, creating contingencies in case something broke during the race. They remade cabinets to gain extra storage space and replaced nearly every bolt and hook.“Each time we did one thing, it was like opening a can of worms,” Arsenault said.The work took almost all of 2021, and at times Neuschafer felt deflated because there was so much to do. But years sailing the rough southern seas had shown her the advantages of having a strong, heavy boat as opposed to the lighter, faster boats of her competitors. She saved space for 100 jars of premade meals donated by French chef Jean-Louis LeClerc and for nearly 100 books.And when she and Arsenault finished, she knew every piece of her redone boat in detail. When something broke on Minnehaha, she would know how to fix it.It would be months into the race before Neuschafer realized how much those efforts had paid off. One by one, the other skippers gave up, their boats damaged. Two quit with broken self-steering systems; one left with rigging problems; another broke his bowsprit. Alone, with scant contact and few indications from the race directors, Neuschafer sailed along, oblivious to the others’ troubles.“I was enjoying my solitude,” she said.She fell into what she called her “routine,” rising early to watch the sunrise and set her direction with the position of the morning sun. She walked the boat looking for signs of scuffing, she adjusted her sails, she napped in the afternoons and kept watch for cargo ships in the evenings.She never felt alone. She knew her friends were tracking her progress on the race’s website. That gave her peace.Mostly, though, she read.She read historical novels written in Afrikaans by Dalene Matthee. She read “The Bookseller of Kabul” in English and a Spanish translation of “The Clan of the Cave Bear.” Wanting to learn Xhosa, a language spoken primarily along South Africa’s southern and east coasts, she brought Xhosa lesson books and a Xhosa dictionary.When a day seemed particularly bleak, she found calm in reading chapters from “The Long Way,” a book written by Bernard Moitessier, a contestant in the original 1968 Golden Globe Race who took to yoga as a means of coping with the trip’s loneliness.Neuschafer also read, in Finnish, a book written by another competitor, 65-year-old Tapio Lehtinen, about his odyssey in the 2018 Golden Globe race. That familiarity made it even more shocking when, three months into the race, a series of alerts came across her satellite phone saying Lehtinen’s boat had sunk and he was floating on a life raft in the middle of the Indian Ocean.Contacting race organizers, Neuschafer learned she was the closest entrant to Lehtinen. Temporarily abandoning the race, she unsealed her phone, activated the GPS and turned on Minnehaha’s engines, sailing all night without sleep to reach him.“You have no idea how difficult it is to find a life raft in the ocean,” she said.Fortunately, Lehtinen spotted Minnehaha’s sails. Once Neuschafer helped him on board, they drank glasses of rum and toasted his survival. Soon after, Lehtinen was transferred to a cargo ship, which also had rerouted in search of him, and Neuschafer resumed her journey.As 2022 turned to 2023, Minnehaha held strong. Competitors kept dropping out until she was one of just three remaining. As she neared the end, she hit windless doldrums near the equator and sat for almost two weeks. She was distraught, certain the others had passed her. To cope, she took long swims away from Minnehaha until the boat was a speck in the distance, before turning back.When the winds finally picked up, she sailed on for France, determined at least to finish. That’s when she received the surprising news that she had won.The first few days after race’s end in Les Sables d’Olonne were like one long party. So many of the people she had come to know from South Africa and Maine and Prince Edward Island and everywhere else had gathered to see her. At first, she was overjoyed, but after a week, she fell sick with the coronavirus. Eight months alone at sea had diminished her immunity.As she recovered, she contemplated her trip and was struck by a sense of emptiness.“It’s funny, what a strange feel time gets when you do something like this,” she said. “It’s been an all-consuming project since 2019 to getting across the finish line. I don’t think it’s hit me yet that it’s all over.”She wants to go home to South Africa. She wants to see her father, who has been ill. She wants, too, to work on Minnehaha, replacing all the pieces that had worn during the journey. Then, she will part with the boat that became her friend on the empty ocean. She will not do the Golden Globe Race again. The second time would never be the same.“I guess I will have to sell her,” Neuschaefer said of Minnehaha, a tinge of sadness in her voice. “That was the thing all along, wasn’t it? Once you have the privilege of owning her, it’s time to pass her along to someone else.”She knows the boat, once repaired, will be worth more than the $65,000 she paid for it, especially with the prestige that will come with having been the winning vessel of the Golden Globe Race.“She had the ultimate sea trial!” Neuschafer said, with the laugh of one of the few people on the planet who could understand.",

      "title": "Europe’s military industrial capabilities fall short of Ukraine’s needs",
      "text": "When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a whirlwind tour of Western capitals this week, the billions of dollars in new military support was a sign that European governments were finally digging deep to provide sustained backing for a protracted war.Zelensky had made clear ahead of his visits to Berlin, Paris and London that Ukraine’s much anticipated counteroffensive could not begin until more weapons and ammunition had been secured.But while British deliveries of long-range missiles known as Storm Shadows could significantly enhance Ukraine’s offensive capabilities, much of the weaponry pledged by European leaders this week is unlikely to reach the battlefield until well after the start of the counteroffensive, military experts say, and Europe’s ability to sustain such support into the future remains unclear.Western governments, in particular European ones, have failed to act fast enough to turn around their industrial policy to meet Ukraine’s growing needs for artillery ammunition, armored vehicles and other weaponry, military experts said. Kyiv’s existing stores of Russian-made equipment are becoming depleted, as are the West’s own stockpiles, raising the risk of shortages in supplies for Ukraine by the end of the year, which will hamper Ukraine’s ability to launch any further offensives, these experts said.Senior Ukrainian officials fear counterattack may not live up to hype“The penny has dropped that this might go on longer and that you have to invest in your industry if we are going to make this sustainable,” said Jack Watling, senior research fellow for Land Warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank. “The fact of the matter is that this was obvious in April last year, but people sat on their hands.”That has led to a growing realization in Western capitals that the piecemeal assistance to Ukraine so far may not be sufficient to allow Kyiv to make more than localized breakthroughs along the 900-mile front line where Russia has spent months fortifying its positions.“History suggests even the stupid are capable of learning, and one of the things we should be very conscious of is that Russia knows this offensive is coming,” said Gen. Richard Barrons, former commander of the British Army’s Joint Forces Command.The flurry of new weapons agreements has not “changed the brutal dynamic of this, which is that the Ukrainian force that is able to execute this offensive … is as big as it’s going to be. It’s got what it’s got,” Barrons continued. “The offensive should have some effect, but it won’t throw every Russian out of Ukraine. In other words, this cannot be the last act in the war, if you are going to keep it going.”And some in Moscow echo that assessment and appear confident that Russia’s military can largely hold its positions, though nervousness is growing over long-range missile supplies and whether Kyiv can break through the land bridge that Russia has carved to the Crimean Peninsula, which would be seen as a significant blow.“Over the last few months, a lot has been done to strengthen the defense lines,” said a longtime member of Russian diplomatic circles who remains in touch with colleagues in the government and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “This doesn’t mean that the Ukrainian counteroffensive can’t achieve any aims. But it means that any attack will be accompanied by significant losses.”A web of trenches shows Russia fears losing CrimeaRussia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 shocked a continent that had for decades funneled its “peace dividend” into economic growth and social spending, while shrinking its armies and hollowing out arsenals.“European militaries over the years had not focused on major war in Europe,” said Camille Grand, who was until last year NATO’s assistant secretary general for defense investment and is now a distinguished policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “That was not core to the planning, and they were not stockpiling ammunition in sufficient numbers for that type of contingency.”NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said the alliance was “continuing to work to rapidly address shortfalls in ammunition stockpiles, enhance interoperability and interchangeability and strengthen the transatlantic industrial base.”“Several allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway and France, have already signed large new contracts with the defense industry, enabling them to invest in increased production capacity,” Lungescu said. NATO declined to provide additional details on the contracts.Much of the announced military aid to Ukraine from Western governments has been sourced from equipment that would have gone out of service anyway, Watling said. “Most of what we have given is stuff we have already paid for a long time ago, and we would have had to pay to decommission it. … We are now talking about a situation where we have to put money on the table because we have to invest in industrial capacity.”The stakes are rising as Russia seeks to paint its war in Ukraine as a battle against the liberal democracies of what it calls the “collective West.”“If we do not stop this threat in Ukraine, it is a threat that we will have to deal with in our own countries, and that is a much more expensive process than doing this. The opportunity here is that we rejuvenate our manufacturing and defeat our main security threat without having any of our own infrastructure targeted or our personnel killed,” Watling added.In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, allies moved quickly to sanction the Kremlin and to rally support to the Ukrainian cause but adopted a bit-by-bit approach on lethal aid, pushing back on Ukrainian requests for certain weapons, before eventually relenting and sending them — then repeating the pattern again.It played out this week with F-16 fighter jets. The Biden administration had maintained that Ukraine didn’t need them despite repeated requests from Zelensky, but this week relented on their export to Ukraine by other countries after some European allies said they were willing to supply them to Kyiv, according to officials familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations between the allies. Washington’s approval is necessary because of third-party transfer agreements associated with the purchase of the U.S.-made jets. It could take months before Ukrainian pilots are trained on the jets. The transfer would also require the sign-off of the chairs and ranking minority-party members of relevant U.S. congressional committees. President Biden has ruled out U.S. deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg helped put the focus on ammunition at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in February, warning that Ukraine was chewing through ammunition much more quickly than it could be produced. Wait times for new large-caliber ammunition had grown from 12 to 28 months, he said.“Just as important as supporting a successful offensive is an industrial policy to match the scale of the war, and we don’t have that yet,” Barrons said. “The most galling thing is that we have lost 13 months of war before we have begun to ramp up industry. We have not seen the sort of industrial activity to give Ukraine the stuff it needs to fight at scale.”The European Commission this month announced a 500 million-euro plan to boost production in Europe of the artillery shells Ukraine needs. Military experts say that although the initiative marks a significant shift, it has been too slow to act. The E.U. is yet to issue any new contracts, Watling and Barrons said, and there has been protracted wrangling over how a separate 1 billion-euro program would be spent to purchase further artillery shells and missiles.Last year, the Ukrainian army was blasting through 180,000 artillery shell rounds per month. Before the war, U.S. production stood at 14,500 shells per month, and E.U. production was around the same. The United States has been faster to respond to depleting stockpiles, boosting domestic production to 20,000 rounds a month and investing in new capacity to eventually increase that to 90,000 rounds per month.In race to arm Ukraine, U.S. faces cracks in its manufacturing mightBut Ukraine is still expending 90,000 to 140,000 rounds a month, according to Watling, while the newly announced E.U. investments in production could take one to two years to come online, despite a call by Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, to move into “war economy mode.”“You don’t have to be a great military analyst to realize that European countries making major investments into artillery production 13 months into the war are a little bit late,” said Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies program at the Center for Naval Analyses. “What’s important is the U.S. has already significantly increased its artillery production. But there’s greater capacity in Europe. It is incumbent upon them to leverage their defense industries and to spend the money.”Others argue that the recent E.U. announcements are still an important message to Russia. “Russia is betting on the fact it can wait out Western resolve. A months-long time frame sends the signal that solidarity holds and support will continue,” said a senior E.U. diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to brief the press. “The numbers [of shells] don’t have practical meaning. It’s that it is sustained.“It sends the message to the Kremlin that, ‘No matter what you think, our policy is set for longer,’” the diplomat continued.Signs are emerging of a parallel effort in Russia to increase production, despite Western sanctions. Data recently published on Russia’s federal treasury website showed Moscow spent 2 trillion rubles ($26 billion) on defense in January and February alone, a 282 percent increase over the same period in 2021, Reuters reported on Monday. Russia is on course to produce 2.5 million artillery shell rounds this year, up from 1.7 million before the war, Watling said.In response to an E.U. pledge to supply Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells over the next 12 months, Russian President Vladimir Putin retorted in March that Moscow would produce three times as many shells over the same period.“Russia has the capacity to mobilize its own economy in support of the armed forces and control its own destiny in a way that Ukraine can’t,” said Barrons. “The critical weakness” for Ukraine “is its reliance on Western inventory and industry.”John Hudson and Dan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this report.Portraits of Ukraine: Every Ukrainian’s life has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion one year ago — in ways both big and small. They have learned to survive and support each other under extreme circumstances, in bomb shelters and hospitals, destroyed apartment complexes and ruined marketplaces.

      "title": "Ukraine’s Zelensky to join Biden and other G-7 leaders in Hiroshima",
      "text": "HIROSHIMA, Japan — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning to attend the Group of Seven nations summit in person this weekend, giving a powerful symbolic boost to his warnings about Russia’s potential to escalate the war in Ukraine by visiting Hiroshima,  a site of nuclear destruction in World War II.Zelensky, who has displayed a knack for resonant gestures and stark messages, has been pressing for more Western support for planes and military equipment, and he has earned new commitments for billions of dollars in military support during recent trips to Germany, France, Italy and Britain — all G-7 members.Zelensky’s surprise visit, along with President Biden’s decision to truncate his trip because of the debt ceiling fight in the U.S., shifts his trip’s focus in many ways from confronting China to supporting Ukraine. The G-7 leaders Friday released their first-ever statement on nuclear disarmament, sharply criticizing Russia’s approach to the issue.“Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, undermining of arms control regimes, and stated intent to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus are dangerous and unacceptable,” the statement said, adding, “We reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible.”The statement also criticized the pursuit of nuclear weapons by North Korea and Iran and asserted that “China’s accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal without transparency nor meaningful dialogue poses a concern to global and regional stability.”But the focus was on Russia, as the leaders of the seven powerful democracies took aim at Moscow’s decision to suspend its participation in New START, its current arms control treaty with the United States, as well as its efforts to capture Ukraine’s nuclear energy facilities.Zelensky had been scheduled to attend the summit virtually on Sunday, but the Ukrainian leader is now expected to come in person on Saturday, according to people familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive travel. Zelensky’s visit, however, was not confirmed publicly by his office, and his precise plans were not clear.His visit, first reported by the Financial Times, is the latest in a flurry of travel by Zelensky outside his war-torn country as he seeks to stave off any slacking of the global effort to help Ukraine, now well into its second year of war. This will be the Ukrainian president’s first visit to Asia since the Russian invasion in February 2022.In another surprise trip, Zelensky on Friday traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he addressed the Arab League summit and meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Zelensky, as he has often does, tailored his comments to his audience, highlighting the plight of the Muslim Tatar population in Crimea, part of Ukraine that was annexed by Russia in 2014.“Look at how much suffering the long term wars have brought to Libya, Syria, Yemen, how many lives have been wasted by years of fighting in Sudan and Somalia, in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Zelensky told the Arab League. “Everyone who adds to suffering by his new aggressions, everyone who sows enmity, everyone who wants to bring back the old days of invading … every aggressor … will be cursed by the people.”President Biden had initially planned a three-country swing through the Indo-Pacific aimed at countering China’s growing influence and economic expansion throughout the region. But his decision to cancel stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia to fly home to deal with an ongoing debt crisis — combined with Zelensky’s in-person visit —  meant Ukraine would be a major focus of the economic summit.Biden was initially scheduled to meet with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia — the other members of the “Quad” aimed at countering China — during his stay in Sydney. That meeting has now been rescheduled for Saturday in Japan.But it’s clear that much of the talk at the G-7 will center on the Ukraine war. “There will be discussions about the state of play on the battlefield,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One before arriving in Japan. “There will be discussions about the state of play on sanctions, and the steps that the G-7 will collectively commit to on enforcement in particular.”The emotional core of the summit revolves around its location in Hiroshima, one of the only two sites, along with the city of Nagasaki, where a nuclear weapon was used in warfare. The world leaders kicked off their summit Friday with a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, paying their respects to the victims of the 1945 bombing by planting a cherry blossom tree grown from one that survived the nuclear attack.The leaders also met privately with Keiko Ogura, a hibakusha, or a survivor of the bombing.Ogura, 85, lived 1½ miles from the hypocenter of the blast as an 8-year-old in 1945. In 1984, she founded Hiroshima Interpreters for Peace, a group that translates the testimonies of A-bomb survivors into English and advocates for a nuclear-free world. Her late husband was the director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.Biden did not offer any public remarks Friday, spending the day mostly behind closed doors with other leaders. Before the visit, Sullivan said the president would not issue an apology on behalf of the United States for the use of the atomic bomb. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed more than 100,000 people, including from radiation poisoning in the days and years after the bombing itself; American leaders argued it was necessary to end the war and prevent even more deaths.“This is not, from his perspective, a bilateral moment,” Sullivan told reporters. “This is him, as one of the G-7 leaders, coming to pay respects both for history but also respects to Prime Minister [Fumio] Kishida, who of course is from Hiroshima.”Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said in an interview before the summit that he did not expect Biden to be asked for an apology, but rather for a commitment to do everything he can to avoid any use of nuclear weapons.“If President Biden understands the inhumanity of the nuclear weapons, and has a true understanding, and has determination that this kind of tragedy should not be repeated, and works for a world with nuclear weapons, and has some concrete strategies or measures to achieve that goal — that’s what we expect from world leaders and President Biden,” Matsui said.Japanese leaders acknowledge that they are making this pitch for disarmament at a time when many countries, from North Korea to Iran, are moving in the opposite direction.“The destructive power of nuclear weapons is just beyond description,” Matsui said. “Reason, rational thinking, should be able to tell us that. That’s what I’d like to expect from world leaders. I know that it is not easy, but if we do not take that course, human beings will be annihilated.”Japan's disarmament push runs into a rising nuclear tideThe G-7 leaders also touched on the novel subject of artificial intelligence and how it should be governed, though they deferred any decisions. The nations’ cabinet ministers will now launch a “Hiroshima AI process” aimed at producing a report by year’s end on how to ensure that AI develops in a way consistent with the G-7′s values.To underline their united front against Russia, the leaders announced new sanctions on Moscow. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on Twitter that the United Kingdom would be “banning all imports of Russian diamonds, copper, aluminum and nickel.”The U.S. announced it was sanctioning 22 individuals and 104 entities, aimed especially at those who have sought ways of getting around the current penalties for engaging with Russia. “We will continue to expand export controls to make it even harder for Russia to sustain its war machine,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement.The Treasury Department also said it was expanding sanctions to target new parts of Russia’s economy.Biden launches Asia trip this week aimed at taking on China“These will go after circumvention. These will go after financial facilitators, as well as future energy and extractive capabilities of Russia and other actors helping to support the war,” the official said. “This will include designations across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.”Julia Mio Inuma and Toluse Olorunnipa in Hiroshima and David L. Stern in Kyiv contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Perspective | Jim Brown was a confounding knot of athleticism, activism and violence",
      "text": "Spend five minutes around Jim Brown, and you would swear he was the baddest man on the planet. There was no way to prove it, of course, but you didn’t dare question the feeling, not while being near him.Talk about presence. When he shook your hand, it felt like he was cracking open a walnut. For so much of his life, he seemed to age without weakening, an enduring vision of strength. Even though he spoke slowly, he commanded attention because of all the wit, insight and audacity flowing from his deep voice. He had a growl as he searched for the right words. And when he found them, he delivered his thoughts with his signature, unmistakable trait: conviction.Brown, who died Thursday at age 87, was an immovable star. He thought he was right even when he was wrong, and he was wrong a lot — abusively wrong and unforgivably wrong at times. As a football legend, actor and civil rights activist, Brown enjoyed a life full of iconic moments, but when considering all of him, he wasn’t really an icon. He was Jim Brown. Jim. Brown. And there was little anyone could do to stop him.He was one of the 10 most important athletes ever to put on a jersey. It doesn’t do Brown justice to consider him only the most dominant running back in NFL history because, in college at Syracuse, he was also a lacrosse superstar in addition to lettering in basketball and track. He went to the NFL in 1957 and won three MVPs in nine record-breaking seasons with the Cleveland Browns, flashing his athletic collage of speed, power, agility and fearlessness. And then he left after the 1965 season, retiring from football officially at 30 years old, to focus on his acting career and to fight harder for African Americans seeking equality during a volatile period in American history.“I could have played longer,” Brown told Sports Illustrated of his decision, which he announced while filming “The Dirty Dozen” in London. “I wanted to play this year, but it was impossible. We’re running behind schedule shooting here, for one thing. I want more mental stimulation than I would have playing football. I want to have a hand in the struggle that is taking place in our country, and I have the opportunity to do that now. I might not a year from now.”And that was it. Brown was done. He didn’t attempt a comeback. He didn’t entertain the idea, except for when he talked about the possibility in 1983 because Franco Harris was getting close to his rushing record. Brown was 47 at the time. Those who watched him win eight rushing titles probably wouldn’t have doubted his ability to play at that age. He was from another time, and even though the game has evolved from the run-dominant era that he owned, Brown still looks on film like the rare player who could transport to today, 60 years later, and be a premier player without overhauling his style.At 6-foot-2 and 230 pounds, Brown would be a slightly smaller Derrick Henry with even more game-breaking, big-play ability and a hand-eye coordination that also would have made him a dangerous receiving threat in a pass-happy league. Consider that Henry, in seven seasons, has three receiving touchdowns. In his nine seasons, Brown had 20. In 1962, in addition to his customary production running the football, Brown led Cleveland in receptions and receiving touchdowns. And he played on a broken toe the whole season. He did whatever he wanted on a football field.He wanted to be just as free away from the game, and in pursuing such liberties for himself, he wanted to uplift his entire race, too. His approach was different from others’, which led to controversy when Brown embraced Donald Trump after he became president. He believed in self-empowerment and didn’t spend much energy on protest. He spoke his mind, but he tried to leverage his celebrity to convince civic leaders to support his causes, including the Amer-I-Can organization that he founded in 1988. For more than 30 years, the program has made an impact in the United States and abroad by helping gang members and prisoners recast their lives, but as Brown grew older, it became harder to fund it. Now his wife, Monique, will be left to maintain a key part of his legacy.In a 1979 interview with The Washington Post, Brown explained his goals and how he wanted to be known.“I was a symbol of a Black man who wanted all of my freedoms,” he said. “It’s very difficult for White America to understand that if you are part of football’s elite why you are not satisfied with recognition and good money. … As an American citizen, I wanted the same rights as all Americans. Anyone who expected me to be overjoyed that I was doing well in football would be disappointed.”From the famous 1967 Cleveland Summit with Muhammad Ali and several prominent Black athletes of that era to his persistence in fighting for what he believed in, Brown did plenty to challenge and better society. But he shouldn’t be remembered in the same way as Bill Russell, who died last summer. Brown’s history of domestic violence, mostly against women, tarnishes any perception of him as a hero.He was arrested at least seven times for assault. In 1968, police suspected that Brown had thrown his girlfriend, Eva Bohn-Chin, off his second-story balcony in Hollywood. Bohn-Chin claimed that she fell accidentally and declined to testify, leading to the dismissal of an assault charge.From the archive: Jim Brown, serving time on his own termsDespite numerous incidents and vile accusations, Brown avoided significant jail time. This is a difficult period in which so many revolutionary sports figures are exiting the world, and in Brown’s case, parts of his life were as ugly as the bigotry he overcame. His defiance was necessary and toxic all at once. There’s ample evidence that the strength many admired in his celebrity transformed into a violent temper in private. It’s a wicked juxtaposition that makes everything about Brown, even appreciating him as a cultural figure to be reckoned with, difficult to capture.Throughout his 87 years, Brown kept making people uncomfortable.

      "title": "How Garret Graves became Republicans’ debt ceiling negotiation frontman",
      "text": "Hours after returning from a meeting on the debt ceiling at the White House, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ushered a group of Republican lawmakers’ spouses around the House floor Tuesday evening. He stood behind the speaker’s dais with a smile on his face, explaining the way the House functions.Just one floor below, with binders tucked under their arms, two negotiators tapped by President Biden entered the south door of the Capitol, heading toward a meeting where they would work to find a solution to the looming crisis. Joining them was Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), whom McCarthy has plucked from a cast of 222 House Republicans to hammer out the critical deal needed to avoid a catastrophic economic default on the United States’ debt.McCarthy’s ability to keep up with the vast aspects of his speaker duties is the result of his deep trust in Graves, whom the California Republican has quickly elevated after seeing in the Louisianian the potential to assuage differences, hammer out deals and translate compromise into policy. Graves’s success in helping find consensus among Republicans to elect McCarthy speaker and corralling the disparate ideological factions of the conference during the first several months of this year — a daunting task by any measure — is why McCarthy’s allies say Graves, 51, is the obvious pick to represent Republicans in ongoing negotiations with the White House.But while Graves’s calm demeanor and attentiveness have earned him respect from many lawmakers, several of his more conservative colleagues worry the more traditional, but still staunchly conservative, Republican’s openness to striking a deal with Democrats will misrepresent — or completely ignore — their attempts to sharply cut spending. Others are irked that Graves has risen so quickly after eight years in the House and does not have the requisite experience for such a high-stakes mission, having never served as committee chair or been elected by his colleagues to leadership.The negotiations have already been a test for Graves.Late Friday morning, Graves exited the first-floor meeting room in the Capitol where he’s been huddling with senior Biden officials to announce a “pause” in discussions, a standstill that comes with less than two weeks until the potential “X date” deadline for when the country could default. Talks between Republicans and the White House resumed seven hours later after McCarthy, Graves, and Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), spent Friday afternoon informing factions of the conference about the hang-ups that remained on varying issues.Appeasing all factions of the conference is a thankless job many Republicans do not want. Though many colleagues and aides believe Graves will deliver a deal that can become law, several privately wonder if McCarthy is positioning Graves as the “fall guy” to blame if negotiations fall apart to appease his far-right flank, which might otherwise move to remove him as speaker.McCarthy has stressed that Graves is eminently qualified to ensure all views are represented, having been the top Republican listening to all “five families” and taking each faction’s input to build their debt ceiling proposal.“Congressman Graves, he’s been elected — appointed to our leadership table and he’s been working with all our different groups and he’s really been the individual that helped put people together in crafting the bill,” McCarthy said at a bicameral news conference Wednesday where he touted House and Senate Republican unity on cutting spending.Graves and key McCarthy officials, including his chief of staff, Dan Meyer, are representing House Republicans in negotiations with two trusted Biden aides: counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young. Young, who was a Democratic staffer on the House Appropriations Committee for over a decade, coincidentally happens to be from the southern Louisiana district that Graves represents.Graves “has a clear understanding of where our members are,” McCarthy said. “I didn’t want to put somebody in that room who didn’t understand that.”In addition to Graves, McHenry — the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, a veteran vote counter and one of McCarthy’s most trusted allies — has been at Graves’s side for some of the talks this week. Both emerged from the Friday evening meeting expressing a lack of confidence that they could reach a deal in principle quickly.“This wasn’t a negotiation tonight,” said Graves, who declined to be interviewed at length for this article. “This was a discussion about realistic numbers, a realistic path forward, and something that truly changes the trajectory of this country’s spending and debt problem.”A common refrain on Capitol Hill is that lawmakers can be separated into two groups: the workhorses and the show horses. Graves, according to his colleagues, has always been the former, putting his head down so much that many Republicans have paid him little mind during his four terms in office.But those who know him best, including current and former staff, often remark that if they want to debate Graves on the policy, it’s best to come overprepared.“He was always a workhorse on policy,” Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) said. “He knows policy, chapter and verse.”Graves’s understanding of the legislative process and how Congress functions stems from his days as a House and Senate staffer. Graves, who attended but never graduated from college, spent almost a decade serving former Rep. Bill Tauzin (R-La.), often helping him draft policy when he chaired the House Energy and Commerce committee. Graves’s vast knowledge on climate and energy policy carried over into the Senate, when he worked for former Louisiana Sens. David Vitter (R) and John Breaux (D).Graves went back home to Baton Rouge in 2008 when then-Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) tapped him to chair the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, a government authority established after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the state. It was in that role that he began negotiating for the state, including with BP PLC after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and learned about the drawn-out permitting process to more quickly jump-start oil and gas projects.Permitting reform has remained one of Graves top policy issues since getting elected to the House in 2014 — a helpful background now that permitting is an area Republicans and the White House hope to find compromise on in the debt ceiling talks. His expertise on energy policy and realism on climate change led McCarthy to appoint him as the top Republican to serve on the House Climate Crisis Committee established under then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in 2019.While serving on the committee, McCarthy again tapped Graves to take the reins of an energy, climate and conservation task force that allowed members to craft policy prescriptions that the majority of the conference ultimately agreed upon to show a united front ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.Since arriving on Capitol Hill, Graves has remained a conservative who toes the party line. According to the Heritage Foundation, which determines how conservative lawmakers are based on votes and bills co-sponsored, Graves has a 96 percent conservative score. He voted with President Trump 90 percent of the time, including objecting to the certification of Pennsylvania’s results from the 2020 election.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who also served on the Climate Committee, glowingly described Graves as a whip-smart and “very animated” colleague, who has a “good sense of humor.” Still, when asked whether he’s confident Graves can land a deal to avoid default, Huffman worried that Graves’s focus on protecting the fossil fuel industry could make it difficult for Democrats to support a possible deal.“Him being [Republicans'] lead negotiator makes me believe I’m about to be served a s— sandwich,” Huffman said.Before Graves became the key “special negotiator” for House Republicans, the wonky congressman, who is also known for having a biting sense of humor, left a critical impression on many in the conference during the GOP’s first week in the majority.Recalling how Republicans began to look like “idiots” after being unable to elect McCarthy as speaker, Graves, McHenry and Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) found themselves offering to help dissolve the tension and hear out the 21 holdouts from the House Freedom Caucus.“Those of us who have a relationship with McCarthy, we get pulled into whatever the hell we’re doing,” said McHenry, who is McCarthy’s closest friend in Congress. “You’re in the soup before you know it.”People in the room with Graves during those grueling days describe being struck by his ability to cut through nonsense and pull people together. He would pull out his laptop, point to each individual to ask what they wanted and take notes of each request. Then he would find what Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) described as “the points of intersection.”Many colleagues saw Graves differently after the speakership fight. That included McCarthy, who gave him the responsibility of chairing the new Elected Leadership Council, composed of chairs and chosen representatives of each ideological faction. Graves also claims membership in the Republican Study Committee, the largest faction of the conference that reflects the most common conservative ideals of the GOP, though some lawmakers have remarked not seeing him attend meetings.As the leader of the ELC, Graves has helped the groups facilitate debate and find consensus to enact policies through Republicans’ razor-thin four-vote majority.“Garret is like Kevin’s policy director,” McHenry said.One House Republican involved in ongoing talks went even further, describing Graves as “the majority leader,” a direct jab at Rep. Steve Scalise (R), a fellow Louisianian who holds the second-highest title in GOP leadership. Graves and Scalise are not particularly close, aides and other lawmakers said.And while the top two GOP leaders get along and coordinate as a team, McCarthy has remained skeptical of Scalise after the Louisianian almost challenged him for minority leader in 2018 after Republicans lost the House majority in the midterms. McCarthy is known for rewarding loyalty and trusting few, according to multiple lawmakers and senior aides, who like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Members of the far-right flank have taken note of that dynamic, privately musing why an equally staunch conservative, like Scalise, is not leading negotiations to ensure that a majority of their debt proposal becomes law. Multiple allies of Scalise say he is happy to keep focused on the other parts of the agenda — which recently includes muscling through a border security bill — while McCarthy, Graves and McHenry get stuck with the highly potent issue of solving the debt crisis.Even so, there is growing skepticism among those in the two most conservative ideological groups that Graves’s tendency to make deals will only water down their proposal — and in turn force McCarthy to agree, instead of keeping his promises to the House Freedom Caucus.Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who never voted in favor of McCarthy for speaker, said he presumes that if McCarthy entrusted Graves with such negotiating responsibility, it means he will “reflect the position of the speaker, which is going to reflect the position in the Republican majority.” But pressed on whether he remains confident Graves will accurately vouch for the Freedom Caucus, Good said, “We’ll see.”In a statement released this week, the Freedom Caucus demanded that McCarthy and Graves cease negotiating with the White House until the Senate passes the House GOP-approved debt ceiling bill. It read as an escalation after a week in which McCarthy had devoted endless opportunities to tout the unity among House Republicans that extends to some in the Senate. Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry (R-Pa.), however, said their ire was directed at the Senate instead of House GOP leadership.Graves also needs to make sure any deal is good with other governance-minded Republicans who have thrown their complete trust behind him to get a good deal done quickly.“Outside of building a DeLorean and going back in time 50 days, this is the best way to do it,” Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) said, referencing the car used to time-travel in “Back to the Future.” “It’s important to understand — particularly on things that we think have a real shot of getting in here — that we understand the policy.”On Friday evening, Graves emerged from the negotiators meeting for the first time all week wearing a casual button-down and a baseball cap that read “Port Nola.” Still tucked under his arm were stacks of papers and an iPad. Unlike many of his colleagues who rushed off the House floor Thursday morning to catch flights home, Graves was sticking to his earlier prediction that he would stay put in the Capitol all weekend.Asked when negotiators could meet again as the clock inched closer to fiscal calamity, Graves calmly said, “It’s indefinite right now. I’m just not sure.”Theodoric Meyer, Tony Romm and Rachel Siegel contributed to this report.The latest: U.S. debt ceiling talks have been paused between the White House and House Republicans.

      "title": "Analysis | Ted Cruz figures out a way to guzzle new Bud Light headlines",
      "text": "One of Sen. Ted Cruz’s unusual skills as a politician is his ability to form-fit culture-war fights into the vernacular and processes of government. Perhaps it’s a function of the Texas Republican’s college-era debate experience, one of the central elements of his biography.After all, those contests were mostly exercises in recasting the virulent subjects of the day into formalized presentations. What’s the difference between that and plucking a snippet from Fox News before turning it into something that could appear in the Congressional Record?A good example of this emerged in the wake of the 2020 election. President Donald Trump was pressuring his allies to join him in calling the election results fraudulent. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was actively trying to keep his caucus from acceding. Cruz, pulled between Trump and McConnell, finally came out with a proposal: What if a congressional committee could “audit” the election results before the electoral votes were counted? He could go on Fox News and talk about fighting “fraud” and get attaboys from Trump, but do it in the guise of simply wanting to procedurally address “unprecedented allegations of voter fraud” — allegations stemming from Trump, of course.This week, Cruz offered an even better example of how he fits political fights into senatorial robes.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpNearly two months ago, trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney posted a short video on Instagram in which she fawned over a few cans of Bud Light bearing her image. It was part of a promotion for the beer company — the post was hashtagged “#budlightpartner” — and promoted a Bud Light giveaway.Measured by the amount of attention the promotion generated, Bud Light hit a home run. But, unfortunately for the brand and its parent company Anheuser-Busch, the vast majority of this attention was very much not positive. The promotion landed at a moment when the political right was particularly keen on using trans people and issues as a target of outrage, and company executives appear to have underappreciated the extent to which their consumer base was made up of members of the political right.In an interview published earlier this year, Alissa Heinerscheid, Bud Light’s vice president of marketing, noted that Bud Light “had been kind of a brand of” — she paused, thinking of the proper word — “fratty, kind of out-of-touch humor.”That isn’t really the right word. “Fratty” implies young, but Heinerscheid herself, at another point in the interview, noted that if “we do not attract young drinkers to come and drink this brand, there will be no future for Bud Light.” What do you get if you combine the ostentatiously (defensively?) machismo-laden vibe of the beer but realize it’s for a significantly older audience? You get a lot of Donald Trump voters.The right-wing media recognized this very quickly. “Bud Light” has been mentioned more than 600 times on Fox News so far this year, compared to about 100 times on CNN and MSNBC combined. Mulvaney has been mentioned nearly 200 times on Fox.Cruz obviously took note. On Wednesday, he and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), herself no stranger to surfing the outrage waves, sent a letter to the CEO of Anheuser-Busch. It took a month and a half, but Cruz finally figured out a way to compress the culture-war fury — that a beer conservatives liked to drink didn’t treat transgender people as gross or nonexistent — into the constraints of appropriate legislative consideration.Well, it turns out that the CEO of Anheuser-Busch is also the head of the Beer Institute, which polices how companies market. And this cracked open a door.“We write to ask that the Beer Institute’s Code Compliance Review Board open an investigation to review Anheuser-Busch’s recent and ongoing marketing partnership with Dylan Mulvaney,” the letter read. “The Beer Institute must examine whether your company violated the Beer Institute’s Advertising/Marketing Code and Buying Guidelines prohibiting marketing to individuals younger than the legal drinking age.”That’s the argument: Mulvaney — whom the letter consistently misgenders, naturally — is an influencer with a young audience. By partnering with Bud Light, the company was (per Cruz and Blackburn) trying to prime kids for alcohol consumption, in keeping with Heinerscheid’s idea that the brand needed to appeal to “young drinkers.” The infamous Joe Camel campaign was, of course, mentioned.It’s a slightly less toxic version of the “groomers” rhetoric that is so popular on the right, suggesting that kids are intentionally being set up for something nefarious.In the letter, Cruz and Blackburn bolster their claims about the presumed age of Mulvaney’s audience with some truly misleading (if not misinformed) argumentation. That Mulvaney is known for documenting her transition in a series called “Days of Girlhood” is cited as though the name means that it is intended for children. One hopes that Cruz didn’t take his own young daughters to see the 2017 film “Girls Trip” in theaters due to a misapprehension about whom the film was depicting.Mostly, though, Cruz and Blackburn cite data on the demographics of Instagram and TikTok users as evidence that the Bud Light promotion would be seen by kids. That TikTok was included is a tell; its audience skews much younger than Instagram’s, bolstering the argument — but the Bud Light video wasn’t published on the platform.“For marketing professionals seeking to reach the age 16 to 24 year old cohort,” the letter reads, “Instagram is an ideal platform.” Ergo, the outreach “had both the design and effect” of marketing to kids.You’ll notice this begs the question. Even if Instagram is the “ideal platform” for reaching 16-to-20-year-olds who can’t legally drink, that doesn’t mean that the Bud Light promotion was meant for that audience.The Beer Institute’s guidelines mandate that ads can only be placed in formats where “at least 73.6% of the audience is expected to be adults of legal drinking age.” The Cruz-Blackburn letter suggests that Instagram didn’t meet that standard, based in part on the “young drinkers” line from Heinerscheid — Cruz must have been confused by the book “Young Guns”! — and on the “general demographics of Instagram.”In 2021, the Pew Research Center found that 71 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds use Instagram, as do 48 percent of those ages 30 to 49. Smaller percentages of people 50 and over do, too, but even among those of retirement age, 1 in 8 report using Instagram.Most of those retirees are admittedly probably not Dylan Mulvaney fans. But here’s a little back-of-the-envelope math. Instagram allows users to sign up if they are age 13 or older. If we apply Pew’s usage percentages to the number of people in each age range in America, and assume (probably erroneously) that usage is even throughout the 18-to-29 age range, only 24 percent of the total Instagram audience is under the legal drinking age if every 13-to-17-year-old in America is on Instagram. In that scenario, 76 percent could be expected to be adults of drinking age.Mulvaney and her team did make one apparent mistake. Instagram’s rules mandate that branded content promoting alcohol be age-gated so that those under 21 can’t view it. I set up a new account for someone age 16, and the content was visible both when linked directly and on Mulvaney’s page.But, of course, none of this is really about Bud Light marketing to kids. That’s just the vehicle that Cruz finally settled on as a way to leverage his elected power to get headlines in the culture-war fight over transgender visibility in America.It worked.",

      "title": "Minor league baseball team to bid Dan Snyder good riddance with Josh Harris promotion",
      "text": "The Bowie Baysox will toast the impending sale of their Prince George’s County neighbors to a group of investors led by Josh Harris with a Washington Commanders ownership change celebration Thursday during their game against the Altoona Curve.As part of the festivities, all fans wearing Washington football team gear may purchase box seats for half-price ($10), while supplies last. In addition, all fans with the first or last name Josh or Harris and anyone wearing a Magic Johnson jersey will receive a free general admission ticket. Johnson, the Los Angeles Lakers Hall of Famer, is a partner in Harris’s group, which on Friday completed a signed agreement to purchase the Commanders from Daniel Snyder — much to the delight of the team’s downtrodden fan base.Baysox General Manager Brian Shallcross said his front office team had been discussing for several weeks ways to celebrate the sale, which still must be approved by the NFL finance committee and ratified by the league’s franchise owners.“We didn’t want to do anything until that type of agreement was in place,” Shallcross said in a phone interview. “We didn’t want to jump the gun.”Shallcross, the GM of the Baltimore Orioles’ Class AA affiliate since 2004, said his team’s original idea was to throw a Snyder retirement party.“Ultimately we decided we just didn’t want to acknowledge Dan that much,” he said of the Commanders’ reviled owner, who bought the team in 1999. “We wanted the promotion to be positive and forward-looking. … It’s hard to find somebody that has positive things to say about the organization and the ownership, so we just thought it was the right time for a celebration.”Rating every game on the Commanders' 2023 scheduleThe Baysox play their home games at Prince George’s Stadium, which is roughly 10 miles from FedEx Field.“The Commanders are our next-door neighbor, and I think minor league baseball is about community, first and foremost,” Shallcross said. “Minor league baseball has a long history of not taking itself too seriously.”(For one game in 2016, the Baysox changed the pronunciation of their name from Boo-ee to Boh-ee in honor of rock musician David Bowie, who died earlier that year. The previous season, they held a back hair appreciation night.)IT'S OVER! Celebrate the long-awaited ownership change of the Washington Commanders with us on Thursday, May 18!Anyone named Josh or Harris receives a free GA ticket. Those in team gear will get discounts with a chance to throw first pitch!More info: https://t.co/mmMFsWnA8B pic.twitter.com/iMEbk5dWvBIn addition to the ticket promotions for Thursday’s game, a fan named Josh, a fan named Harris and a fan wearing a Magic Johnson jersey will throw ceremonial first pitches. Between innings, the Baysox will take a tongue-in-cheek look back at the Commanders’ past 24 years, and Shallcross suggested Snyder’s bizarre “Happy Thanksgiving” greeting at the January 2020 news conference to introduce Ron Rivera as coach might be featured. Cake will be served to bolster the party atmosphere.Shallcross grew up a Philadelphia Eagles fan, but now he cheers for the Buffalo Bills because they’re coached by his former roommate at William & Mary, Sean McDermott. Still, he sympathizes with Commanders supporters. In 2012, the Baysox appealed to some of those fans by announcing that Snyder’s former right-hand man, Vinny Cerrato, would appear in a dunk tank at the team’s annual football kickoff celebration to raise money for charity. Cerrato ultimately backed out.“We talked about having a dunk tank with someone named Dan, and we just thought it was a step too far,” Shallcross said of the various ideas his team considered for this week’s celebration. “There’s so much toxic that you could dive into, but ultimately we wanted to make it more of a celebration for the Commanders fans who have been waiting for this day. … We’re in the business of making people laugh and smile, and hopefully this Thursday people will come laugh and smile.”",

      "title": "Analysis | Republicans keep having bad elections",
      "text": "Republicans haven’t really had a good election day since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade 11 months ago, and that continued Tuesday night.The big news out of Tuesday’s slate of non-primary elections is that Republicans lost mayoral seats they have long dominated in two larger cities: Jacksonville, Fla., and Colorado Springs. But Democrats also got some relatively good signs elsewhere in special elections. Together, this fills out a picture of a 2023 election cycle in which they continue to overperform, as they began to do almost immediately post-Roe.Let’s recap.Donna Deegan’s win in Jacksonville marked just the second time Democrats have won a mayor’s race there in the last 30 years. She also won by four points in an electorate that favored Republicans by double digits in most statewide races in 2022. (Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, won by 11.)The victor in Colorado Springs was not a Democrat but rather an independent and a moderate, businessman Yemi Mobolade. But Mobolade’s victory over Republican former Colorado secretary of state Wayne Williams marks the first time since 1979 that Colorado Springs won’t have a registered Republican as its mayor. Republicans lost the race by 15 points in a city that only narrowly favored Gov. Jared Polis (D) a few months ago. (And Polis, it bears emphasizing, benefited from facing a flawed GOP opponent.)Tuesday’s elections also featured results in a series of state legislative races that largely mirrored the results of what was a good 2020 election for Democrats.In Pennsylvania, Democrats held the 163rd state House district, which crucially restored their majority in the chamber. In both that and another state legislative race, they slightly underperformed President Biden’s numbers in those districts but overperformed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 results, according to numbers crunched by Daily Kos Elections.Takeaways from Kentucky and Pennsylvania primary election results 2023Elsewhere, Democrats continued to overperform the 2020 results. In a special election for a Kentucky state Senate district, Democrats slightly improved upon both their 2016 and 2020 presidential performances. And in a New Hampshire state House district, a 27-point Biden district delivered a 43-point win.All told, according to the Daily Kos Elections numbers, Democrats have overperformed the 2020 presidential results by an average of six points across 18 state legislative races this year. (And again, that was a good election for them.) They’ve also beaten their 2016 margins by an average of 10 points.And that doesn’t include the highest offices on the ballot thus far in 2023. In a crucial Wisconsin state Supreme Court race, the Democratic-aligned candidate won by 11 points, ending 15 years of conservative control of the court. And in the only special congressional election of 2023 so far, in Virginia, Democrats beat their 2020 margin by double digits.This is, of course, still a relatively small number of races, and it’s still a long way until the 2024 election. The value of these results in predicting races that are more than 17 months away is small, as FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich wrote back in February. But special elections have historically provided significant clues about where things stand, especially when you look at them holistically rather than analyzing one or two high-profile contests.More than anything, though, the 2023 results thus far look a lot like the special election results occurring after Roe was overturned in June 2022. Republicans had been overperforming in special elections before that date, but afterward the trend flipped on a dime. Democrats overperformed their 2020 margins in all five special congressional elections held between that date and midterm Election Day, by an average of more than five points — similar to their six-point improvement in state legislative races so far in 2023.That wound up being instructive. Despite some theorizing about a “red wave,” Democrats had one of the best midterm elections for a president’s party in the last century. They lost the House, but they actually gained Senate seats, governor’s seats and state legislative chambers. And they of course also did well in the 2018 and 2020 elections.For now, the limited 2023 evidence suggests Republicans haven’t done much to right their ship.",

      "title": "Endless posing: the constant, awkward photos at world summits",
      "text": "HIROSHIMA, Japan — They came, from miles and hours away. They saw, viewing the sobering and spectacular sites the area has to offer.And they took photos. Lots and lots of photos.While the three-day Group of Seven summit here contains weighty discussion of the most intractable global problems, it can at times appear as if these powerful world leaders do few things more frequently than get in front of a camera.They pose with one another every few hours, in different settings and various arrangements.Just after Biden arrived here on Thursday, before even stopping at his hotel, he posed for a photo outside of a ballroom with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan ahead of their meeting.The next morning, Kishida greeted him again, for another photo, each of their wives standing with them as they walked together in Peace Memorial Park, a site that is dedicated to the victims of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States in 1945.There was a series of photos a few minutes later with all of the G-7 leaders, first as they walked together. Then as they each laid down a wreath. Then as they shoveled dirt to plant a tree.Later that night, they gathered again, and again posed for group photos. They stood at the Itsukushima Shrine, a holy place of Shintoism, walking through the stunning complex and stopping at a wooden jetty facing the ceremonial Torri gate in the shallow sea.They paused for photos, and then stayed, chatting and laughing.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wandered off to the end of the jetty, but no one followed him and he came back. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak could be heard exclaiming loudly how “lovely” it all was.The leaders then went over to listen to traditional music before heading off, admiring the sights. Biden spent time chatting with Trudeau.The photo gatherings are one of the few windows during international summits where the leaders are on public display, the body language and personality quirks of each head of state clearly visible. Their conversations, which usually occur behind closed doors, can be overheard, however briefly.During one photo session at a NATO summit in 2017, President Donald Trump drew international headlines after he physically pushed aside Montenegro’s prime minister, Dusko Markovic, as leaders walked into position.Among the most colorful — some would say unfortunate — photos come from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summits, where leaders traditionally pose for “family photos” in sometimes-gaudy shirts that represent the host country. The tradition has sometimes been called the “silly shirts” photo and various world leaders have tried to do away with it, but the practice endures.APEC's \"silly shirts\"--the tradition that won't go awayEven without colorful garb, the jostling of powerful leaders, each accustomed to being the center of attention, preparing for photos can awkward — or just odd. At the G-7 summit last year, then-prime minister Boris Johnson joked about how the assembled leaders might intimidate Russian President Vladimir Putin.“Jackets on? Jackets off? Shall we take our clothes off?” Johnson asked as the leaders prepared for the informal photo before their lunch meeting.“We all have to show that we’re tougher than Putin,” the British leader joked at the summit in Schloss Elmau, Germany.“We’re going to get the bare-chested horseback riding display,” quipped Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, referring to the Russian president’s predilection for distributing photos of himself outdoors and sometimes shirtless, including on horseback.“There you go! There you go! We’ve got to show them our pecs!” Johnson added.There was less of that joviality here, at least in front of cameras and with last year’s main instigator — Johnson — no longer in power.On Saturday, with camera batteries no doubt recharged, there were more chances for more photos.Biden arrived around noon at the Grand Prince Hotel, where the G-7 summit is taking place, and the leaders gathered outside, with Hiroshima Bay and green mountains in the background and gunboats in the water.Biden stood between Kishida and Scholz. Several leaders waved and remarked about how bright it was outside. French President Emmanuel Macron gave a thumbs-up.Two minutes after they entered, they were gone.

      "title": "Analysis | Pence would start a 2024 campaign in a historically bad position",
      "text": "Former vice president Mike Pence appears set to launch his 2024 campaign for president. If he does, he would be seeking the nomination of a party that has turned away from not just his brand of politics, but him personally.The good news for Pence is that there is at least some precedent for someone as disliked as he is winning the Republican presidential nomination and the presidency. The bad news is that the precedent is Donald Trump, the man he has to get past and the very reason many Republicans soured on Pence in the first place.Polling shows Pence would begin his 2024 campaign as a historically unpopular candidate.Recent polls from Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the Associated Press show only a slight majority of Republicans like him, and as many as 4 in 10 dislike him. This is members of his own party. (The turning point is clear: As Philip Bump noted, Pence’s favorable rating fell off a cliff after he declined to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021, and it hasn’t recovered.)Because of this intraparty resistance, Pence’s overall numbers are poor — historically poor, in fact, for a major presidential candidate. The Journal poll shows 60 percent of Americans overall have an unfavorable view of Pence, compared to 29 percent favorable. The other polls are slightly better for him.The Washington Post in 2016 reviewed polling numbers for presidential nominees and other significant candidates dating back 30 years. The only ones who have cracked 60 percent unfavorable? Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke (69 percent unfavorable) in 1992, Pat Buchanan (60 percent) in 2000, Newt Gingrich (63 percent) in 2012 and Trump (67 percent) in 2016.You’ll note, of course, that one of those candidates wound up being quite successful.Trump actually had even worse numbers before launching his campaign. A May 2015 Washington Post-ABC News poll showed 71 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Republicans had an unfavorable view of him. Trump’s unfavorable number among Republicans was a whopping 42 points higher than his favorable number.But shortly after his campaign launch, the same poll quickly showed a reversal. Suddenly, 57 percent of Republicans liked Trump, while 40 percent disliked him.Which is about where Pence would start his 2024 campaign.As Bump noted, we should hardly expect such a reversal for Pence when he launches his campaign. Trump benefited from being a well-known but largely undefined political entity. So when he launched his campaign on a theme of harsh opposition to illegal immigration, a large segment of the GOP ate it up. Over time, he convinced most of the remaining holdouts.Pence, by contrast, has a well-established political brand that he apparently won’t be abandoning. He’ll probably run a traditional, conservative, Reagan Republican campaign focused on ideas that have become less popular on the right, including supporting Ukraine, entitlement reform and free trade.This is, in some ways, the campaign Pence has to run, because anything else would be a major departure for him. But the gamble seems to be that the party might ultimately return to its foundations for whatever reason. That would necessitate a large-scale Republican Party break with Trump and Trumpism. Pence’s bad numbers can’t really improve unless Trump’s numbers revert.For now, Pence is remarkably off the radar for a former vice president, and it’s not just the image numbers. While a slight majority of Republicans still like him, a recent CBS News poll showed 57 percent of Republicans said they would not consider voting for him. That was worse only than more staunch Trump critics Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson. And a recent Monmouth University poll showed nearly half of Republicans (47 percent) said they would not be satisfied with Pence as their nominee. More voters said they would be satisfied with eight other Republicans tested; only Christie, Liz Cheney and Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) scored lower by this measure.Not where you want to be starting. But after 2016, never say never.",

      "title": "White House, GOP resume debt ceiling talks after brief breakdown",
      "text": "White House officials and congressional Republicans resumed negotiations over the federal debt ceiling late Friday, hours after a breakdown in talks sent shudders through the financial system and intensified fears that the U.S. government would run short of cash to pay all its bills.With the risk of default looming in just two weeks, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Fox Business late Friday that he was calling negotiators back to the Capitol. GOP officials had abruptly walked out of negotiations on Friday morning, complaining that they had made little progress in persuading the White House to accept significant cuts to federal spending, a key Republican demand. A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe administration planning, confirmed that negotiators would resume talks. The two sides met for about 90 minutes before breaking and leaving the Capitol but said they would continue working elsewhere through the night.If the U.S. defaults, see what payments are at risk.The White House and congressional Republicans are at odds over multiple issues, but the question of where to set spending levels for the fiscal year that begins in October has emerged as a major sticking point. McCarthy has pushed for an agreement that would trim $100 billion from agency budgets in exchange for Republican support for lifting the debt ceiling. Democrats argue that such steep reductions would harm the economy and slash a range of critical services for families and businesses.Each side has accused the other of intransigence with time running short. President Biden has cut short an overseas trip and plans to return to Washington on Sunday.The debt ceiling is the legal limit on government borrowing — currently set at $31.4 trillion. Since the national debt hit that level in January, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has been taking extraordinary measures to balance the nation’s books. But she has warned that time is running out on those tactics, and that the Treasury Department could run short of cash as soon as June 1 unless Congress acts to raise the debt ceiling.On Friday, Goldman Sachs issued a note projecting that Treasury reserves should be sufficient to make payments through June 8 or 9, when the risk of running out of cash would become severe. Failure to make critical payments — whether military paychecks, Social Security benefits or interest on previously issued debt — could tip the nation into an unprecedented default.Government officials from both parties agree that such a scenario could be devastating, potentially sparking a global financial crisis and plunging the United States into recession. The deadline and fear of fallout has led lawmakers to seek a compromise, but the leading negotiators — Biden and McCarthy — have come under immense pressure from their respective parties in recent days not to give too much to the other side.McCarthy has said he needed an agreement in principle by this weekend for the House to ensure the debt ceiling is not breached — a target that is now all but sure to be missed.World watches in disbelief as U.S. nears debt defaultSome on Capitol Hill interpreted Friday’s pause in talks  as a potential negotiating ploy aimed at assuring both sides that their leaders are fighting aggressively for their priorities.Biden has faced mounting criticism from some Democrats over his decision to entertain new work requirements in certain federal benefit programs for the poor. On Friday, 66 liberal Democrats sent a letter urging Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment and essentially declare the debt limit unconstitutional — a move that would allow Treasury theoretically to continue to borrow and allow the White House to avoid caving to Republicans demands. Meanwhile, McCarthy has faced fresh attacks from the conservative House Freedom Caucus over signs that the deal would not sufficiently cut spending.Before Friday’s pause, lawmakers had appeared to be making progress on the contours of the agreement. In addition to temporarily raising the debt limit, talks have focused on clawing back some unused money meant for coronavirus relief programs, reforming the permitting process for energy projects and creating new work requirements for certain federal programs. But negotiators have had little luck resolving what has long appeared to be the most intractable issue: how much money the government should spend during the budget year that begins in October and whether increases in spending should be capped in subsequent years. Republicans have sought trillions of dollars in cuts to a huge portion of the federal budget, and Democrats have resisted those changes.White House officials and congressional negotiators face an extreme time crunch if they want to cut a deal before June 1, when $10 billion in military salaries and retirement funds are scheduled to be issued, followed by $25 billion in Social Security benefit payments on June 2. It’s unclear what would happen to those payments if the government doesn’t have enough cash on hand.1/4Several people close to the negotiations said lawmakers remained divided over the extent and duration of new restrictions on federal spending. House Republicans have pushed for spending limits on a substantial pool of federal funding that excludes programs such as Social Security and Medicare, but otherwise aim to restrain the growth of spending on an enormous part of the U.S. government. In talks, GOP negotiators have pushed these “spending caps” on domestic spending — including education, transportation, and scientific programs — to reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars.Democratic lawmakers are wary of these plans, in part because they believe similar measures enacted during the Obama administration contributed to significantly slower economic growth and could hurt important government programs.One core dispute in the talks has been over how long these spending “caps” should remain in effect. Democrats want the spending cuts to last for roughly two years, after which appropriators could more easily increase the budget. But Republicans have sought to impose the restrictions for  a decade, a move that would more significantly reduce future borrowing.“This was always going to be an issue,” said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank. “Republicans are looking for major savings over the next 10 years, while the administration clearly does not want to lock in 10-year numbers and are looking at a much shorter time frame.”Just as difficult is how steep the first year of spending cuts should be. McCarthy’s push for at least $100 billion in cuts in 2024, and then more in subsequent years, reflects internal pressure from Republicans to deliver spending reductions that cannot be reversed later. But Democratic lawmakers strongly resist such measures for the same reason, believing that spending cuts that are scheduled to occur years from now are less likely to ultimately take effect.On Fox Business on Friday night, McCarthy said Republicans would not accept a deal that permits spending more in the upcoming fiscal year than the government is currently spending.“It is very frustrating if they want to come into the room and think we’ll spend more money next year than we did this year,” McCarthy said.Lawmakers from both parties have agreed that if the United States defaulted on its debts for the first time in history it would be catastrophic. White House economists said in an analysis earlier this month that an extended breach of the nation’s borrowing limit could wipe out more than 8 million jobs and cause “severe” economic damage.The limit is a cap on the total amount of money that the United States is authorized to borrow to fund the government and fulfill its financial obligations. It is not new spending but rather allows the country to spend money on programs that Congress has authorized.John Wagner contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Police in Brazil indicted the former head and deputy head of the country’s Indigenous affairs agency for failing to take “necessary measures” to prevent the killings of a British journalist and a Brazilian Indigenous expert in the Javari Valley of the Amazon rainforest last year.The disappearance of former agency official Bruno Pereira, 41, and journalist Dom Phillips, 57, in June 2022 sparked outrage in Brazil and beyond. Pereira, a longtime official with Brazil’s Indigenous affairs agency, had been threatened for his work mapping criminal activity in the valley, while Phillips was a Brazil-based correspondent who wrote for the Guardian and The Washington Post.Ten days after they disappeared their bodies were found, after  a fisherman confessed to their killing. He and two others have been charged over the murders, while five more inhabitants of the river community were accused by police of helping to hide the bodies.The killing of Dom and BrunoThe police statement released Friday did not name the two former officials of Brazil’s Indigenous affairs agency Funai, but identified them as the agency’s former president and former vice president. It said they were suspected of “possible malice” after they became aware of a risk to the lives of agency employees during a meeting in October 2019 and through other documents, but failed to act to protect them.“In this way, they would have assumed the risk of the result of their omissions, which culminated in the double homicide,” it added.The indictment will be looked at by federal prosecutors who will decide whether to file charges in court.Brazil’s state-owned news agency, Agência Brasil, identified the two ex-officials as Marcelo Xavier, who was president of the Indigenous agency from July 2019 until December 2022, and former deputy president Alcir Amaral Teixeira.According to Brazilian daily newspaper O Globo, the meeting at which the two officials became aware of the risk to the Funai staff came after the death of agent Maxciel Pereira, who was killed while investigating illegal fishing in the Amazon in September 2019. Weeks later, Bruno Pereira took a leave of absence from the agency after being removed from his senior position, saying he needed a break after the death of his colleague and given “the climate of tension” at the agency. He did not return.Xavier was appointed by former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whose term in office oversaw an acceleration in deforestation in the Amazon and policies that “seriously” threatened the rights of Indigenous peoples, according to Human Rights Watch.The Yanomami are dying of malaria and malnutrition.

      "text": "Dimitri Jones, a 29-year-old YouTube creator, never thought he’d stop playing “NBA 2K,” the popular video game franchise centered around professional basketball. He’s played the game since he was young and even started his own YouTube channel, where he posts 2K-related content.But the most recent game, “NBA 2K23,” has shaken his faith.“Before, I would say I wouldn’t ever leave 2k behind,” he said. “I still somewhat hold onto that thought process. If the trend continues this way with 2K, I could see a time in which I never play it again.”Jones is not alone. “NBA 2K” fans aren’t happy about the state of the game, especially after developers posted their latest blog post Wednesday, sharing what’s coming in the next six weeks — or, as some fans said, what’s not coming. Mega-fans are concerned that the game isn’t giving them much to do and question whether it’s a sign that 2K isn’t listening to its community anymore.“I think the community just wants the company to act like they care whatsoever about the consumer,” said Jones, who previously partnered with 2K through the company’s NextMakers initiative, a training program that gives creators access to 2K Games’ intellectual properties and professional development network.Since “NBA 2K21,” the NBA 2K franchise has taken hints from other video games like “Fortnite” and “Call of Duty” by adding a seasons concept, where players can earn specific in-game rewards and items over a set course of time. (In “NBA 2K23,” seasons last every six weeks.)The seasonal rewards are vital to one of the modes called “MyTeam,” in which gamers collect digital basketball cards of past, present and future NBA players that they can then use in the game. The digital cards are earned through playing the game, buying them on the game’s auction house or opening digital packs, which can be purchased with real money. A single pack costs about $5 and, on most occasions this year, offers less than a 2% chance at the most valuable cards, which have enhanced abilities in the game.These packs appear to be the focus of the upcoming Season 7. According to the 2K blog post, the game will make 450 cards available in each new pack for the season. In addition, the packs will feature cards based on NBA players in the league’s playoffs, which began on April 15 and will conclude with the NBA Finals beginning on June 1. Much to the chagrin of fans, no specific events, challenges or in-game competitions to reward gamers (other than the typical seasonal rewards) were mentioned in the blog.“Now it feels like the only reason to play the game is if you enjoy the thrill of gambling on packs,” said Mick Curley, a 26-year-old from Ireland who runs a YouTube channel under the name “DBG.”Curley, something of a “NBA 2K” YouTube historian who records documentaries on each year’s games, said he won’t walk away from the game for now because he’s still creating content. “But I can’t see myself ever booting up 2K again” when he’s not running the channel, he added.Hector Ostolaza, a 41-year-old Twitch streamer from Boston, said he was “anticipating disappointment” from the Season 7 blog post, “and my expectation was right.”That’s a problem, he said, because it seems 2K wants to “engage less” with fans and not participate in “the general discourse regarding their game.”One of the biggest issues, Ostolaza said, is that the best player cards are unlocked in the digital packs — not from playing the game. If something is earned through playing the game, it can’t compete with what you may earn in packs.“Our time is not being rewarded, and neither is our dollar, frankly,” he said, citing the poor odds of the packs.The 2K community will “get fed up” if there’s more of the same, Ostolaza said. “I’m already less engaged in the game, and many others are in the same boat. The user base feels like it’s being taken advantage of and taken for granted.”Michael Knight, 29, of Prince George’s County, Md., said he didn’t have a negative reaction to the blog “because I don’t have high expectations for 2K anymore.”“It honestly felt like they gave up,” he said. “The company shows they don’t care about their product at all and it’s become just too much honestly.”But Knight may not walk away yet, because “2K still gives me those moments where I feel like this is the best basketball game I’ve ever played.”The NBA 2K franchise is still played by millions worldwide. The company’s CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an earnings call Wednesday that “NBA 2K23” has sold more than 11 million units — a record for the series, he said — and had its highest-ever sales of virtual currency, too (which is used for buying packs, accessories and more). The game has about 2.3 million daily active users, he said.Tyler DeBondt, a 23-year-old YouTube creator and two-time winner of NBA 2K’s online tournament, said 2K needs to address its fan base.“2K needs to realize that the community and our thoughts are important and should be taken into consideration instead of pushing us away,” he said.A 2K Games spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",

      "title": "Perspective | The Heat is no ordinary No. 8 seed, and the Celtics are paying for it",
      "text": "BOSTON — From now on, let’s forget about the whole eighth-seed business. Toss it out. Consider it an unfortunate typo discovered in the NBA playoffs bracket. Or just an arbitrary digit there for window dressing.It now feels like an insult to attach that number to the Miami Heat.Eighth seeds don’t play like this team. They don’t invade a notoriously loud and hostile arena, pillaging away home court and leaving the locals in white and green stunned and silenced. They don’t overcome a 12-point deficit in the fourth quarter, then hold their opponent — the one with a pair of all-NBA stars — to just two field goals in the last six minutes. They certainly don’t win the first pair of games in the Eastern Conference finals, performing like the tougher, better organized and more poised outfit that the higher seed only wishes it could be.On Friday night, Miami made another mockery of the East’s bracket, picking apart the second-seeded Boston Celtics for a 111-105 win. An eighth seed is approaching the doorstep of the NBA Finals, and reminding everyone that yes, numbers do lie. That number assigned to the Heat does not reflect the way this team should be viewed.“I don’t think we’ve ever considered ourselves an eight seed,” said Heat forward Caleb Martin, who poured in 25 points off the bench. “Obviously we put ourselves in that position through the regular season, but we always knew what we were capable of as a team. We have always had confidence in each other and great chemistry throughout the team. So we just knew we had to get here, and once we got here, things would play out in our favor. As for the favorites, who had been picked to win the series, the Celtics folded when it mattered. Resembling their worst selves from last year’s run to the championship round, the Celtics are still prone to costly, late turnovers and they still operate in panicked sets — that’s if they try to run anything at all. Jayson Tatum missed his three field goal attempts in the fourth quarter. Jaylen Brown misfired on four of five shots, and as Boston tried to protect its vanishing lead, he committed a traveling turnover. Despite the experience the Celtics gained from going six games with the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 Finals, this is their second consecutive series in which they’ve fallen into a serious hole.“Just effort,” center Robert Williams III said. “Playing the right way the whole game, honestly, in my opinion. And trusting each other. We got to gain that trust and keep that trust throughout the whole game.”The Heat have not shown those same limitations in this series. They have a grown-up vibe about them. Even in the morning, when someone chooses the Isley Brothers then Teddy Pendergrass as background music while players get shots up. “Close the Door” might not be the typical pregame, get-hype tune for most NBA teams. For the Heat, however, it’s a slow jam that soothes, then provides subliminal instruction to put the Celtics to bed. Between the two teams, Miami looks like the veteran side ready to play in June.“We know what we’re capable of. We going to be in this thing until the end together, good, bad, indifferent,” said Butler, who played all but seven minutes Game 2 and scored 27 points. “We are who we are … and we are going to continue to fight together.”And so moving forward, those numbers in front of the team names — eight and two — should be reimagined.Eight could very well represent Miami’s aggression level. Boston’s registers at a measly two. Or: Eight, the number of points Heat center Bam Adebayo scored in the fourth quarter Friday night, as well as many rebounds he grabbed in the final frame.As Miami made its comeback, Adebayo showed little respect for Al Horford’s ability to defend him one-on-one, taking him to the paint and drawing two foul shots that trimmed the lead to 100-98 with 3:33 remaining. Then, inside the final minute, Adebayo cleaned up a missed shot by Butler with a putback dunk. A skilled yet powerful big man, Adebayo finished one assist shy of a triple-double with 22 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists. Also, eight: The number of memes “Mad Jimmy” created any time Boston backup Grant Williams attempted to challenge him.Martin bestowed this latest nickname on his teammate, inspired by the testy fourth-quarter exchange between Butler and Williams. Though postgame, Butler expressed admiration for Williams, who logged a surprising 26 minutes after collecting a DNP in Game 1, he showed nothing but disdain after scoring over him, which led to a confrontation in which the two men shouted at one another, forehead to forehead.“That’s just competition at its finest. He hit a big shot. Started talking to me; I like that. I’m all for that. It makes me key in a lot more,” Butler said. “It makes me smile. It does. When people talk to me, I’m like: ‘Okay, I know I’m a decent player, if you want to talk to me out of everybody that you can talk to.’ But it’s just competition. I do respect him, though. He’s a big part of what they try to do. He switches. He can shoot the ball. I just don’t know if I’m the best person to talk to.”When their foreheads touched, Boston led 96-87 with 6:22 to play. The Heat closed the game on a 24-9 run. Never talk to “Mad Jimmy.”“I knew that you could kind of see it in his eyes that he was ready to go after that,” Martin said. “He leads, we follow. He makes it easy on all of us.”Now, strictly for the record, this sentence has to be written: The eighth-seeded Heat took a two games-to-none lead in the conference finals. Beginning Sunday, when the series moves to Miami for Games 3 and 4, the Heat will have a chance to do the improbable and sweep the second seed. Improbable because this very Miami roster needed to survive the play-in tournament just to secure the final spot in the postseason. That experience, as well as a rocky regular season, must have created this eighth-seeded monster.“Feels like this has just been our existence all year long. I guess nobody is really paying attention,” Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Every single game, it felt like for weeks on end, every game was ending on the last-second shot, whether we’re shooting it or the other team is shooting it. So you develop some grit from that. Whether that turns into confidence or not, sometimes you don’t have the confidence. But at least you have that experience of going through stuff and you understand how tough it is.”",

      "title": "Analysis | Missing in this year’s debt-ceiling talks: Democratic demands for new taxes",
      "text": "In late May 2011, Vice President Biden exited a meeting on Capitol Hill to declare that he had delivered a “clear” edict in those negotiations over raising the nation’s federal debt limit.“Revenues are going to have to be in the deal, and everybody knows that,” Biden told reporters, using Democratic parlance for raising taxes on the rich.Twelve years later, during another debt standoff with a new House GOP majority, President Biden and his allies have not made higher taxes on the rich and powerful a centerpiece of the talks.Instead, following Republican admonitions that raising taxes is a nonstarter, Democrats have focused their line of attack against House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and have made dire predictions of defaulting on the federal debt.When opening the Senate floor on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Republicans of “hostage taking” and warned “the consequences would be horrific” without a deal by early June.On Wednesday morning, a day after Biden’s meeting with the top four congressional leaders, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Democratic colleagues that outlined the demands he set forth in the Oval Office: “Addressing the debt ceiling must be accomplished without gamesmanship, brinkmanship and the extreme imposition of painful spending cuts.”Neither Democratic leader mentioned the possibility of raising taxes as a way to counter Republican demands for spending cuts. Nor did either offer any other substantive liberal policy alternatives as a rejoinder to the conservative proposals pushed by McCarthy to stiffen work requirements for some federal entitlement programs and to ease regulations on energy production.See how the national debt grew to $31 trillionAll that is making rank-and-file Democrats increasingly question the negotiating strategy of their party’s leadership. For months, Biden and top congressional leaders mocked Republicans with the “show us your plan” message that seemed anchored in the belief that, with just a four-vote majority, any McCarthy proposal would fail to clear the House.After McCarthy narrowly got his very conservative proposal through the House in late April, Biden’s party simply declared there would be no negotiations over the full faith and credit of the U.S. debt.That posture crumbled once Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, backed up by other independent analyses, said the U.S. would run out of money to pay the nation’s obligations by June 1 or a few days later. The potential crisis was at hand and posturing was no longer an option. Now, Biden’s team is in a full-blown negotiation.Republicans have their wish list, most of which will be rejected or whittled down, but the Democratic counter-offer has been largely nonexistent.“Had Republicans’ demand for spending reductions been immediately countered with a White House demand for revenue increases, a legitimate deficit reduction negotiation could have ensued. But now the White House is negotiating against itself, and in the words of Benjamin Franklin, necessity never made a good bargain,” Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) said Thursday.Some Senate Democrats privately praised a Twitter thread from progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) for handicapping that a final bipartisan deal would only get about 150 Republican votes in the House. These Democrats do not expect to negotiate a “clean” debt ceiling vote, as she suggested, but saw her words as a sign that maybe their party should have used this leverage. After all, McCarthy will need Democratic votes to pass any final deal if his most conservative colleagues oppose the final compromise.Here’s the deal: McCarthy has nowhere near the votes for a deal and therefore cannot negotiate debt ceiling.You need 218 votes. GOP has maybe ~150. They will need anywhere from 50-100 House Dems to pass anything.Dems have 213 votes for a clean bill & just need to pick up 5.This muted approach to tax policy comes after Democrats moved from their fearful days of being labeled “tax-and-spend liberals,” back in the 1980s and 1990s, to going on offense by promising to raise rates on the wealthy.It’s been a politically winning message since Democrats honed it during the 2011 and 2012 fiscal fights between President Barack Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).Obama — sometimes with Biden acting as his negotiating proxy — pushed to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 and to eliminate loopholes that big corporations used to avoid paying their full share. It became a central theme of his successful 2012 reelection campaign.Democrats did not get tax hikes in the 2011 debt ceiling resolution, but Republicans caved almost 18 months later and allowed higher rates on those making more than $400,000, among other tax hikes.To be sure, Biden this time did propose a budget outline in early March that would reduce deficits by $3 trillion largely through raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 and eliminating corporate loopholes. He has highlighted these proposals at events such as his May 10 trip to the Hudson Valley, but the focus of those remarks came on how the House plan would lead to deep spending cuts on local programs.During a phone call earlier this month, White House aides floated about a dozen different ideas to raise tax revenue, including ending many tax loopholes. The Republicans rejected every single one of them.“We’ve brought them up in the negotiations,” Schumer told reporters Thursday.But critics like Phillips noted that they only learned about those tax proposals from the work of Jeff Stein, The Washington Post’s White House economics reporter, who broke the news on Monday.The people were on background and Democratic leaders have done little since then to amplify the argument that Republicans are defending specialty tax breaks for the wealthy.GOP rejected White House effort to close tax loopholes in debt ceiling talksThis shyness comes even though Democrats continue to believe the tax issue breaks their way with voters, more so than ever before.When the Republicans took full charge of Washington in 2017, they slashed taxes by nearly $2 trillion — for which they received no political gain. Democrats highlighted how the tax cuts significantly contributed to the national debt and did not target the middle class, helping them flip the House in the 2018 midterms.“If you look at the massive cuts under the Trump administration, those were actually a detriment for the Republicans because they gave all the tax breaks to the very wealthy and powerful corporations, and middle-class folks were left out,” Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said Thursday.Back in July 2012, the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans said Obama’s plan to raise taxes would help the economy, 22 percent said it would hurt, while the rest said it would make no difference. Among Republicans, a combined 51 percent said raising taxes would help or make no difference to the economy.Last month, ahead of tax day, Pew found that 61 percent of Americans were bothered “a lot” that some corporations do not pay their “fair share” in taxes, with another 22 percent somewhat bothered. Even Republicans view the issue as a problem: 46 percent were bothered “a lot” by corporations avoiding taxes.As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Peters is encouraging candidates in 2024 to highlight tax fairness as a key issue.“It’s a powerful issue. There’s no question about it,” he said.In 2011, Biden and Democrats made sure tax hikes were on the table. They even got Boehner to consider nearly $1 trillion in new revenue before the deal fell apart. It set the stage for their campaigns in 2012 and that year-end “fiscal cliff” talks that ended with Democratic wins on taxes.Democrats may make a more forceful pitch to raise taxes on the rich, in a later debate, or during campaigns in the fall of 2024. For now, they have left the issue on the sidelines of this debt debate.There’s not much choice, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. The debt talks have “taken so much time” that the “X date” is fast approaching, he said. The Democrats’ best hope now is to avert disaster and then try for policy wins in the annual funding bills for the federal government.“I’m concerned about avoiding default. I’m deeply concerned that we are close to a precipice that will be catastrophic for our country,” Blumenthal said Thursday. “And I support the president and our leadership in trying to avoid that kind of calamity.”The latest: U.S. debt ceiling talks have been paused between the White House and House Republicans. If the debt ceiling isn’t raised by the deadline, here’s what a government default means and the payments at risk. Here are the negotiators hammering out a debt ceiling deal.Understanding the debt ceiling fight: Biden and the House Republican leadership are on a collision course over the national debt limit. In this comic, see how hitting the debt ceiling could unleash chaos. Here’s when the debt ceiling battle could end.What is at stake? Invoking the 14th Amendment to dodge the debt limit is risky, White House officials say. If the debt limit is breached, Biden warned that it could send the U.S. economy into a free fall. The debt ceiling breach could wipe out 8 million jobs, a recent analysis found. Amid consumer anxiety over the uncertainty, financial experts warn against making fear-based decisions.",

      "title": "Analysis | Root for Mage in the Preakness Stakes, but look elsewhere for bets",
      "text": "If you are looking for a big score in this year’s Preakness Stakes, I have bad news. Mage, the Kentucky Derby winner and 8-5 morning-line favorite at Pimlico, looks legitimate. Many of the other horses in this small, seven-horse field haven’t won anything more than a maiden race — an event for horses that have not yet won a race — on a fast dirt track, and few have been able to finish among the top three after a fast pace.Odds, post positions and analysis for the 2023 Preakness StakesAs for speed, only two of the horses in the field — National Treasure and Mage — have come close to earning a final speed figure near par for races of this level. (Graded stakes winners in routes — one mile or longer — usually win with an average speed figure of at least 105.)However, Mage and National Treasure produced their triple-digit speed figures in races that were classified as fast-fast, meaning there was an above-average time to the second call (three-quarter mile mark) and final time. None of the other horses have prevailed under those conditions. The field is so meager that the prevailing joke is the race should be renamed the “Weakness.”Mage towers above the field in speed and class, leaving few quality upset choices. If you still hope to shop around, look for a horse that can press the pace and be close to the leaders at the second call, after three-quarters of a mile has been run. During the most recent winter meet at the Baltimore track, 10 of 14 winning horses in graded stakes at similar distances were within 2¼ lengths of the lead at that point. This spring, that lead at the second call shrank to 1¾ lengths.Horses expected to be in the mix at the second call Saturday, aside from Mage, include Blazing Sevens, Coffeewithchris and National Treasure. Of those, only National Treasure appears to have a real chance at pulling an upset. Unfortunately, he should be the second choice in the race.Placing a win bet in this race is going to be tricky, but using a personal odds line can ensure you get the value you need to justify going to the window. A personal odds line involves ranking your best horses and assigning your contenders a combined 80 percent chance to win, with the non-contenders earning the remaining 20 percent. In this case, I would narrow the list of contenders to Mage, National Treasure and Red Route One, in that order. Mage is going to be such a popular choice it will be nearly impossible to get value on him in the win pools. If you assign him odds of 8-5 on your personal odds line, you are saying he has an almost 40 percent chance to win, which uses half of your 80 percent allotment for contenders. That would make the other two contenders 4-1 on your personal odds line. If you are thinking the odds you need won’t allow a win bet, well, you would be right. This might be a pass in the win pools.The exotic payouts also will be suppressed if Mage wins as an overwhelming favorite in a small field, which is smaller still when you factor in the legitimate contenders. There will be too many trifecta (pick the first three finishers in order) and superfecta (pick the first four finishers in order) tickets with Mage at the top plus National Treasure in the place slot. Your only hope for a big payout with Mage winning is two long shots finishing second and third, and that feels too difficult for this group.There is one scenario worth exploring that could lead to a nice return on investment, and it involves a fast pace that breaks down, allowing a closer to pass tired horses in the stretch. To take advantage of this possibility, you would single Red Route One on top of the two main contenders — Mage and National Treasure — in a trifecta. You might even add Perform as a candidate for show. You could improve your return by not using Mage at all.The best bet of all, however, might be to pass on the race entirely. I know that’s boring, but in a race with little value, it’s probably the right thing to do.",

      "title": "Review | 2023 Spring Dining Guide",
      "text": "Show restaurants that are...Here’s hoping you like French food, Asian flavors and brand extensions, because my spring collection of new places to eat brims with opportunities to taste the top trends of the past year or so.If you’ve been following my restaurant rounds in and around Washington, you know your ravenous guide has been eating a lot of baguettes, hoisting more than a few chopsticks and frequenting spinoffs of popular dining establishments. (Thank you, José Andrés, Peter Chang and others.)Are dining rooms more crowded these days? It sure feels that way, judging from all the hard-to-book restaurants — and the din within. “We missed gathering,” says Rose Previte, owner of the spirited new Kirby Club in Fairfax, Va., where the demand for group bookings represents “a new appreciation” among diners.[The perfect restaurant doesn't exist. Readers helped me create one.]Sign of the times: Americans spent 20.7 percent more at restaurants than they spent on groceries last year, Axios reported last month. Given high prices in general, some people are opting to let others do the cooking.LEFT: Stuffed Piquillo Peppers at the Bazaar by José Andrés. (Scott Suchman for The Washington Post)  RIGHT: Bartender Fernando Granja mixes drinks at Amazonia. (Scott Suchman for The Washington Post)  Sorry to say, quiet restaurants are rarer than ever these days, prompting me to fantasize about ways restaurants could enhance the overall dining experience. Read on for my list of 10 suggestions, based in part on what followers have shared on my weekly online discussion.The following list highlights my pick of the current crop — 25 young restaurants, half in the suburbs, where I’d be happy to go on my own dollar (dimes being so yesterday). If there’s a fresh face you don’t see, it could be the result of recent chef changes, the need for more time to prove itself, or simply because life is short and you deserve the best.The DistrictMains $26 to $38 at Amazonia and $125 for six-course chef’s tasting menu at Causa.Carlos Delgado says he wanted to “build a new way of Peruvian eating,” and that’s exactly what he’s accomplished with two restaurants under one roof in Blagden Alley, Amazonia and Causa. The former is a rakish bar and dining room with a jungle of an outdoor terrace on the rooftop and snacks including skewers. The latter — off the entrance and opening with a pristine display of fish — showcases a six-course tasting menu that your guide introduces as if it were a trip: “We’re going to touch on coastal cooking, then the Andes, and finish in the Amazon.”Here’s what I love about the bar: pretty much everything? Drinks are not just balanced, they’re beautiful. The pisco-spirited Anticuchería, hinting of smoke and fruit, shows up in a terra-cotta vessel with spiced pineapple and a banana leaf. The kitchen gives fresh meaning to “bar food.” Skewered salmon belly melts on the tongue; a morsel of garlicky plantain topped with pork tallow becomes irresistible nigiri; and hearts of palm and creamy avocado make for a fetching salad when they’re carpeted with fried plantain coins. Throw in smart service and plush seating and you get a line outside before the door opens.[Amazonia and Causa: Two delicious tastes of Peru under one roof]Here’s what I love about the fine dining: Once a parade of exquisite small bites are cleared at Causa, Delgado makes it his mission to spend as much time as possible with his audience. Here he is, adding liquid nitrogen to yellowtail and sweet potato, a sparkling ceviche (and a reminder he once worked for José Andrés). Another course, Delgado explains the ancient practice of cooking layers of food underground over hot stones — pachamanca — as we slice into succulent Wagyu beef short ribs lapped with a reduction of black mint, beef stock and soy sauce and served with a modern whip of cauliflower. The list of piscos seems endless, like the varieties of potatoes in Peru, and you have to admire priorities like the newly acquired $15,000 dryer — just for aging fish.Supplements can send your bill skyward, but even the base dinner here is as much a master class in Peruvian history and geography as celebration of one of the world’s finest pantries.Here’s why you should book a trip to either attraction: Nobody in this country is cooking Peruvian at this level, with as much dedication and craftsmanship, as Delgado.Dreams do come true at Amazonia and Causa — his and diners’. 920 Blagden Alley NW. 202-780-8607. causadc.com.

My only quibble is how long it took for the esteemed chef, Peter Chang, to feed the District as superbly as he’s done over the years in his many restaurants in Maryland, Virginia and beyond.Dishes you’ve tried in other Chinese places taste like truer, elevated versions here. The delightful roar of Chang Chang’s kung pao chicken is matched by the pedigree of the star of the show — free-range chicken from D’Artagnan — and fried walnut prawns steer clear of the usual cloying glop thanks to a velvety glaze of condensed milk and orange juice. Wrinkly green beans tossed with pickled cabbage, part of some of the best takeout in recent memory, whisks me to Sichuan, the Chinese province famous for its bold flavors.[Worth the wait: Peter Chang finally opens a Chinese restaurant in D.C.]Dishes you can’t source anywhere else — duck “four ways” comes to mind — turn any night into a celebration. The spectacle is fired to order and takes 45 minutes to get to the table. Patience is rewarded by a platter of sliced, smoked, five-spiced duck, plus a ginger-spiked broth and a phyllo-swaddled pie stuffed with forbidden rice and shredded duck confit.There’s no getting bored with the ever-evolving menu. For spring, the cooks have lightened the delectable, tongue-numbing tofu skin salad with cured cucumbers, and they’ve introduced a revivifying yellowtail crudo whose cool is underscored by julienne green apple and challenged by hot mustard. Co-owner and pastry maestro Pichet Ong says raw fish — yusheng in Chinese — symbolizes good luck. The crudo at Chang Chang definitely makes me feel fortunate.Note that lunch is different from dinner is separate from takeout, and you really, really need to get your chopsticks around the knife-cut noodles strewn with crumbled pork and steamed clams. Ong calls the combination “surf and turf white Bolognese.” The plate, like his cakes, is sublime. 1200 19th St. NW. 202-570-0946. changchangdc.com. Lunch and dinner daily. Indoor and outdoor seating.

No need for a sad trombone, though. Before he left, he made sure his kitchen colleagues continued cooking as if he were still in the house.Long story short: Kirby Club, brought to life by Rose Previte, the vision behind the popular Maydan and Compass Rose in Washington, remains a luscious source for dips, kebabs and “picnic platters” at the Mosaic District in Northern Virginia.[Kirby Club adds luscious dips, kebabs and ‘picnic platters’ to Fairfax]The menu acknowledges that the world is made up of some people who want their own plate of food and others who don’t mind competing for the last morsel of whatever on a platter.Non-sharers will rejoice over the plates for one, featuring a variety of kebabs — chicken, lamb, oyster (mushroom) — that feel like a feast given the fluffy yellow rice, sumac-spiked onions and bright salad that accompany them. “Picnic platters” are a throwback to Previte’s childhood memories of Labor Day spreads with the Kirby Club, a Lebanese social group her maternal grandparents helped found in 1933 in Akron, Ohio. My ongoing fascination is the whole roast chicken, massaged with garlic, turmeric and oil and presented on a raft of flatbread with the aforementioned rice and salad, but also crinkle-cut fries sprinkled with za’atar and a rainbow of sauces.But first, some starters. First among equals is the muhammara, dark with charred red peppers and sweet-tart with pomegranate. Then again, the falafel are also excellent snacks, flavored with the same coriander, garlic and onion the departed chef recalled from his youthful grazing in Cairo.New to the script: lunch hours, and the possibility of couscous bowls and “handhelds” — lavash wraps stuffed with a choice of chicken shawarma, falafel with pickled eggplant or (mmm) juice-spurting beef-and-lamb kofta with melted feta cheese, tomato and the spark of pickled onions. Any wrap is better with a fistful of sumac-flavored pita chips.The Kirby Club is personalized with a central bar, walls with mod colors evoking the 1970s and an album’s worth of Previte’s family photographs. “It’s always sunny here,” an attendant says of the vibe and the flavors. For sure, for sure, and the good times are expected to roll on this fall in Clarendon with a second location. 2911 District Ave., Fairfax, Va. 571-430-3650. kirbyclub.com.

Pearly slices of swordfish splashed with smoky chile sauce fan across a crisp tortilla, making for the hautest (and hottest) tostada around. A lovely riff on lasagna showcases pink cooked prosciutto and a vivid mint-fresh pesto. Rice-stuffed tomato sounds plain in print, but what a glory going down! Grains tinted with green tomato mojo inside a peeled, roasted tomato served on a trio of sauces is an egg-capped Valentine to vegetarians.[Joy by Seven Reasons gives diners lots to cheer, even a $65 sandwich]In all, this is whimsical food (and drink) with serious talent behind it, foremost chef William Morles Gonzalez and his boss, Venezuelan chef Enrique Limardo, whose innovative Latin American restaurant in Washington, Seven Reasons, lends its name to this spirited dining draw in Chevy Chase.“Have fun, get crazy, be sexy, enjoy,” requests the menu of the window-wrapped restaurant best-known for a truly “Colossal” $65 short rib sandwich that can easily feed three or four.Leave it to Joy to turn a command into contentment. 5471 Wisconsin Ave., Chevy Chase, Md. 202-417-8968. joybysevenreasons.com.

This is a restaurant that (gasp!) bothers to answer its phone during service, responds to email, offers more than pasta to welcome vegetarians, makes top-shelf drinks at prices that won’t break the bank, lists steak on its kids menu and feels like a family-owned enterprise, — because it is.Meet chefs Michael and Ally Stebner, partners in life and in business. He’s the smile you see circulating in the light-filled dining room; she’s the one minding the open kitchen. The couple’s menu marries trends (cauliflower piccata) and comforts (roast chicken), much of which pick up flavor from a charcoal grill.[Local Provisions in Sterling is a mom and pop that checks all the boxes]Open only since January, Local Provisions is the success it is thanks in large part to the years Michael spent in the fast-casual industry, where he worked for such admired brands as True Food Kitchen, Sweetgreen and Cava. Originally, the Stebners planned to open something similar in Sterling. Locals let them know they wanted someplace “to sit down and be comfortable,” says Michael. He and Ally changed course, acknowledging a full-service restaurant would better “feed our souls as chefs.”Smart move. The appetizers alone would get my business. Fritto misto and grilled octopus look and taste like starters you’d find at expense-account places in Washington; rafts of house-baked bread slathered with tangy goat cheese, plied with slices of roasted squash and drizzled with spiced honey are meatless — and memorable. Further into the script are a juicy lamb burger jazzed up with pickled peppers and sesame focaccia; a zippy rigatoni Bolognese sized as if for two chowhounds; and a roast chicken that arrives nicely charred, with a bright olive relish and a bed of sliced potatoes that soak up the delicious pan juices.A stack of booster seats near the restrooms affirms Local Provisions’ family-friendliness. But repeat visits have taught me the restaurant is just as good for date night, girls’ getaways and … well, name the occasion and this newcomer rises to greet it. 46286 Cranston St., Sterling, Va. 571-299-0789. localprovisionsva.com.

Set in the Waldorf Astoria, it’s a gift to the city that made Andrés the chef and humanitarian he is today, the son of Spain says.Your eyes won’t know where to focus. In one part of the opulent, second-floor dining room, a carver wields a knife like a surgeon on the cured leg of an Iberian pig fed a diet of acorns. In another, a server is whipping up a caipirinha from a silver bowl of liquid nitrogen, lime juice and the spirit cachaça. Multiple long tables reinforce the chef’s idea of the American Dream: “longer tables, not higher walls,” says the Man Who Needs No Introduction.[The Bazaar by José Andrés is his dream come true in Washington]The epic menu looks backward and forward but also lets diners savor the here and now. The late America Eats Tavern is recalled with dishes including the country’s daintiest chicken wings. Served on skewers, the deboned, pressed and fried wings are glossed with a rich hot sauce and finished with a cube of blue cheese. No need to lick your fingers, but you’re likely to smack your lips with every glorious bite.The food, incorporating ideas from Jaleo, Minibar and the star chef’s other dining draws, comes in well-paced waves. Imagine an onion soup that’s by turns hot and cold in every spoonful, a “Philly cheesesteak” rethought with Wagyu beef and blimp-like “air bread” filled with a whip of cheddar cheese, and a salad of Japanese peaches and burrata arranged as if by an artist. Andrés is fascinated with frying and fritters. Spring for the sumptuous conch fritters — near-liquid with bechamel and onion in the center and light and golden as the best tempura outside.Reservations aren’t easy, but price-wise, the Bazaar is one of the city’s more accessible special-occasion retreats. 1100 Pennsylvania Ave. NW. 202-868-5088. thebazaar.com.

That’s the case at this Thai newcomer in Woodley Park, a neighborhood better known for its zoo and park than must-eat restaurants.Happily, Donsak is a force for the delicious. Co-owned by Supisa Teawbut, a former manager at the nearby Beau Thai, and Boontom Ratana, previously the chef at Urban Thai in Arlington, the cozy storefront is named for the southern city in Thailand known for its seafood and includes a page devoted to Esaan cooking. It’s a style the chef, a native of northeastern Thailand, knows well.[Donsak Thai Restaurant is required eating in Woodley Park]Donsak performs the requisite paces for most Thai restaurants. You’ll find among the starters papaya salad, larb with plenty of chile heat, and steamed dumplings fat with crab, pork and shrimp. Little touches set this kitchen apart from the pack, though. Take the papaya salad, for which Ratana cuts the fruit by hand, so the pieces are irregular, and also fries raw peanuts instead of buying roasted ones in bulk.The curries prove distinctive, too. Red curry with fried squash bobbing in spiced coconut milk and the Esaan-style, pull-no-punches water-based curry with Thai eggplant are first among equals. The dish I wouldn’t dream of missing here is a three-ring circus for the palate called nham kao tod: rice seasoned with herbs and curry paste, fried to a crackle then broken into pieces and tossed with julienne fermented ham, peanuts, onions and shards of fresh ginger.Good news for nearby customers: Donsak delivers free within a 1 1/2-mile radius with a $20 minimum order. 2608 Connecticut Ave. NW. 202-507-8207 donsakthai.com.

Mix in the perfume of cooked meat and music blared at club volume.A diner could be forgiven for mistaking the scene at Hulu Skewer House for a Korean barbecue. In reality, it’s a Chinese restaurant specializing in threaded seafood, meat and vegetables — ingredients warmed over custom-made electric grills with rotating spindles that take away the need for stir-cooking. Popular in China, where the novelty originated pre-pandemic, according to co-owner Shichao “Jonathan” Wang, the trend made its debut in Rockville on New Year’s Eve.The two-floor, industrial-looking restaurant is the effort of eight friends who simply craved a place to “chill and have fun,” says Wang, who works for a bio-tech company. (Hulu is a nod to a Chinese animated series, Huluwa, which features eight central characters.) Aside from the noise, the dining room on the main floor is comfortable and stylish, dressed with broad tables and leather chairs that encourage lingering. There are multiple ways to dine — a la carte and combinations for two or four that include extras such as beef noodle soup — and one way to order: via QR code, which allows you to select in Chinese or English.Part of the fun is watching dinner go from raw to ready (and sometimes, “wow!”). The rocking motion of the grill is hypnotic. Little fish cakes tan and puff up like marshmallows. Taiwanese sausages go round and round, sweating sweet juices. Bites of chicken, slick with chiles, let you know they’re ready by throwing their spicy scent in your direction. Dozens of options — red-tipped clams, sweet potatoes, pork belly, etc. — inspire repeat visits. Once the skewered items are cooked, they’re placed on a rack above the grill. Tiny forks are used to release the hot morsels from the skewers.Servers are attentive about monitoring the tables to see that nothing gets overcooked, but less inclined to introduce diners to the condiments that appear on sleek gold trays. Pro tip: Sprinkle some of the cumin seasoning on the justifiably top-selling lamb skewers. You’ll want to round out your meal with something prepared by the kitchen — cooling chopped cucumbers garnished with cilantro, maybe, or split roasted eggplant showered with scallions and red pepper and finished with garlic sauce. Pass on the chewy pork dumplings, though.More rotation can be enjoyed upstairs — in the form of songs — where the restaurant stocks six karaoke rooms and a full bar. 1488 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Md. 301-302-8989. huluskewer.com.

The demand for fine dining was more than met by the city’s supply, he added.Inside or out? It’s a toss-up when the weather’s on your side. Il Piatto (“the dish” in Italian) offers one of the most tempting outdoor dining spaces around. Bordered with greenery and shaded with umbrellas, the alfresco seating takes in the steeple of St. John’s Church and the top half of the Washington Monument: dinner and (a bit of) a show. Inside, Ilhan retained almost everything from Mirabelle but the linens on the tables: capacious semicircular booths, burgundy leather panels, lots of brass trim and lighting that’s as arty as it is practical.[Il Piatto is a looker with pastas priced to please in downtown D.C.]A change of guard in March finds Sfoglina veteran Francisco Vargas in the kitchen, but the price of main courses unchanged. They still average an agreeable $26. Nothing on the all-day menu is likely to send you to Google Translate. But much of what I liked in the opening days continues to please me now. The juicy meatballs, showered with filings of parmesan, are rolled from ground beef loosely held together with milk-soaked bread and egg and warmed in fresh tomato sauce. The fried calamari sport a clingy buttermilk batter and get a nice charge from a garnish of pickled vegetables. Lamb chops marinated with rosemary and garlic are my go-to meat, and ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta comes draped in a creamy tomato sauce.New to the script: pasta primavera, an ode to the season whose headliners include artichokes, asparagus and green olives. 900 16th St. NW. 202-506-3833. ilpiattodc.com.

Others, like this marble-paved newcomer in Vienna, seduce you the moment you step inside. Ingle’s booths and banquettes are the color of toffee, its granite tables preset with crystal wine glasses. Rare amid the Korean competition, a greenery-topped bar mixes distinctive cocktails. Owner James Jang says he envisioned the restaurant as “a place I could bring my parents for a special occasion.”Their good fortune is ours. The focus is on beef — four cuts per order and about a pound of meat for two diners — rounded out with dishes to share. Ingle’s steak tartare, topped with mustard seeds and batons of Asian pear, is terrific. But given the likelihood of grilled beef to follow, you might want to ease in with seafood: some of the best steamed mussels around, gathered in a butter-kissed broth, or folds of salmon sashimi hidden within a racy cabbage salad.[This new Korean steakhouse masters the grill — and everything else]On with the show! All the tables are dressed with brass grills, which a server swabs with a chunk of tallow so the incoming meat doesn’t stick. Sometimes, a thick slice of radish goes next, creating a rest stop for the pieces of cooked beef, which a server keeps separate, so there’s no confusing, say, short ribs from rib fingers. For the sake of comparison, try both the plain and marinated kalbi, the latter of which crisps as the seasonings caramelize. The kitchen’s delicious dips are an opportunity to compare and contrast and graze the night away. Want to bring your own wine? Corkage is $30 a bottle (although staff is known to overlook charging beyond one flask from outside).The owner’s secret weapon is his sister, Evelyn Jang, who came to Ingle with a gilded résumé, having worked at some of the most hospitable restaurants in the United States and Seoul. She’s back in Korea now, but her know-how lives on in servers who can answer any food question, napkins folded just so and the door held open as you depart — admirable touches from start to finish. 8369 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, Va. 202-845-4966.  inglekoreansteakhouse.com.

If you’re anything like me, you’ll be glad to make the acquaintance of lightly cooked seafood draped with a curtain of pureed brined duck eggs and evaporated milk, festooned with fried shallots and scallions. Catch the Thai chile heat and the garlic punch in the combination? It’s a personal statement, and a delicious success, coaxed from just six or so ingredients.Welcome to Jiwa Singapura, an uncommon taste of Singapore from Spain native Pepe Moncayo, who lived and loved in the faraway city-state before relocating to Washington to open the Spanish-Japanese Cranes. The newcomer, set off with a swarm of glass “orchids” suspended from on high, unfolds in the glitzy Tysons Galleria and more or less lives up to it’s English translation: “the soul of Singapore.”[A top chef brings a sublime taste of Singapore to McLean]Salted egg shrimp keeps good company. Take chicken rice — sliced poached chicken paired with rice cooked with aromatics in chicken fat for a creamy mouthfeel — a national obsession found in restaurants humble and haute throughout Singapore. Bundled like a gift in banana leaves, a mash of dorade, lemongrass and chiles makes for a memorable steamed fish cake. Beef rendang isn’t worth the 30-minute wait, but I wouldn’t think of dining here without getting the chili crab, a feast that involves pillowy milk buns — and a bib and plastic gloves. (Messy? For sure. Memorable? You bet.)Niceties including a box for purses and rests for silverware suggest you’re in a fine-dining lair. In fact, you’re in a suburban mall, dining like they do in Singapore: extremely well. 2100 International Dr., McLean, Va. 571-425-4101. jiwasingapura.com. Dinner Wednesday through Sunday.

En route to the restaurant, a text message from L’Avant-Garde warns me tables are held just 10 minutes; at the table, a host greets my party with “You have the table for two hours.” Meanwhile, a senior suit on the team engages us with all the warmth of Lurch. Charm is not the newcomer’s strength.Turn your attention to the menu. Printed in both French and English, which is either on point or pretentious, the list gathers all sorts of dishes to make you glad France native chef Gilles Epié came to Washington. Born in Brittany, Epié trained under some of his country’s most revered chefs — Roger Jaloux, the longtime chef de cuisine for the legendary Paul Bocuse; Alain Senderens, another founding father of nouvelle cuisine — and received a Michelin star for his work at Le Pavillon des Princes in Paris when he was just 22.[L’Avant-Garde is raising the bar for French dining in D.C.]The experience shows in dish after dish. If bread is attached to anything, get it. My first taste of Epié’s cooking was a little globe of puff pastry atop a maritime “bouillabaisse” of John Dory and other fish, a soup that includes tender macaroni and a rouille teasing with harissa. A little kitchen magic produces his signature duck foie gras beignet, an orb with a shell, made from a beer batter, that crisps in the fryer and breaks open to reveal both solid and liquid foie gras. Spoonfuls of port wine reduction give the dish gloss and sweetness. Thicks slices of peppery chateaubriand, staged atop crisp potatoes Anna, are dressed up with a colorful garland of vegetables cooked just so. This is the place to ease in with a jade gimlet that lives up to the promise, marvel at how a few pristine ingredients — scallops, bone marrow and black truffles — can impress, and finish with a rich chocolate souffle.The interior is equally beguiling. Ribs of wood stretch across the walls. Gold domed lights illuminate the luxe, semicircular booths. Save for the zinc bar, L’Avant-Garde is free of French restaurant stereotypes. And everything you touch shows thought. A marble coaster supports your cocktail, for instance.Maintain expectations, enlist the help of the gracious sommelier, and you’re in for a night to remember.

As with the young L’Avant-Garde, the service can take a back seat to some of the singular sensations emerging from the open kitchen. If you’re looking for the city’s best lobster thermidor, an omelet for dinner, or Paris-Brest for dessert, Le Clou has you covered.All three Gallic comers have in common a top chef, in Le Clou’s case, Nicholas Stefanelli, best known in Washington for his Italian cooking at restaurants including Masseria. The chef likes to remind us his training is French and burgundies are his passion. Allow me to pronounce his poulet rôti as good as his pastas.The day-to-day cooking is executed with flair and consistency by chef de cuisine Nico Cezar. Count on the omelet at Le Clou always to be rich with French butter, tangy with crème fraîche and gilded with caviar. The only thing different about the excellent sweetbreads might be a change of accessories for the season: creamed fava beans instead of wintry cauliflower and shaved truffles. The steak frites deserves better than frozen fries, but I love to know about a place that offers frogs legs.Set off the hotel lobby, the airy dining room mixes comfort with chic. Baby-blue chairs and brown leather banquettes front the swirled marble tables, and a recently arrived champagne cart feels like the appropriate fizz.

Too labor-intensive, a server told me.A spring visit nevertheless found reason to cheer: some fresh additions to the menu, including pearly poached shrimp and breezy mint on a sauce made refreshing with coconut milk and lime, and gingery noodles, cooked in duck fat brown butter and paired with sauteed bok choy and pea pods scattered with frizzy fried shallots.[Little Vietnam is a good thing in a small package in Washington]The venture features a clutch of talent who worked for the D.C.-based Daikaya Group in a shoe box that seats 22, including a handful of stools looking into the open kitchen. Claustrophobes need not apply. The menu is equally concise, just 10 dishes last time I was in. Count me a big fan of the steamed dumplings filled with juicy ground lamb that’s warm with black cumin and sharp with lemongrass, as well as the banh xeo, a turmeric-tinted crisp crepe packed with shrimp, ground pork, mung beans and bean sprouts smoky from the wok.The otherwise neighborly restaurant comes with an easy-to-resolve flaw: noise.

Ground before it goes into the dish, the TNT is invisible to the eye. But the tongue immediately detects a bonfire, which hotheads will appreciate.Launched by Myint’s parents in 2000, Mandalay shuttered in 2021 and reopened nine months later, with delivery and takeout. Recently, the dining room reopened with limited hours (11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and 5 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday for dinner). “I don’t have the staff” to do more, says Myint, who also halved the number of seats in the bare-bones restaurant to 40.The owner’s wife is Mandalay’s chef, Latt Naing, who relies on Myint family recipes. Recent delivery and in-person takeout showed care in the packaging — pieces of cardboard separated cold and hot dishes — and encouraged future orders from the epic list. Among the hits were green tea leaf salad, lightly crunchy with cabbage, yellow peas and roasted garlic; a standout curry marrying tender chunks of pork and pickled mango; and sliced beef in a cilantro-punched tomato curry. The doughnut-like gram fritters are fluffy sops for the sauces, including the onion-laced, fish-based mohinga, a dusky gold soup eaten with rice noodles and considered the national dish of Myanmar (also known as Burma).Myint’s parents are retired but make occasional stops. “They make sure we’re doing the right thing,” their son says with a laugh. “If not, we hear about it.” 930 Bonifant St., Silver Spring, Md. 301-250-4078. mandalayrestaurantcafe.com.

With her two sons, Phil and Alex, the executive chef introduced a third branch of the family’s popular chain-lette to Shirlington in March. Even when it’s raining, the newcomer feels sunny, a sense propelled by chalk-white walls, greenery snaking around the room, splashes of blue and a couple murals capturing Mom’s home island in western Greece.My initial taste of the chef’s cooking — fingers of fried cod with skordalia and a juicy teepee of skewered lamb, beef and chicken — was at the original Our Mom Eugenia, launched in Great Falls in 2016. (A second location opened in Fairfax in 2020.) My latest sampling, in Arlington, whisked me back in time and spoke to the owners’ philosophy: “Consistency is our No. 1 goal,” says Alex.[Greek cooking just like Mom made (because Mom actually made it)]Dish after dish in Shirlington continues to make me feel like a guest in Eugenia’s home. You’ll want some spreads, offered with warm pita, to start; fish roe whipped with lemon juice and olive oil — a maritime cloud — is a must. A cold day is countered with lemon-kissed chicken soup, and any time is a good excuse for the succulent baked chicken or mixed grill, each morsel of lamb, beef and chicken cooked as if by its own minder.Don’t eat meat? The vegetarian platter brings together spanakopita so crisp you hear the phyllo shatter, beets splashed with balsamic vinegar and dusted with crushed pistachios, and creamy gigante beans sauced with tomato. The sampler, including baby eggplant scattered with pine nuts and fresh mint, makes a nice appetizer for two. Whole branzino comes with a field of vegetables — crisp green beans, dill-flecked carrots, lemony roast potatoes — and a little ceremony as the grilled fish is proffered on a tray and deftly filleted by a manager.Attention, event planners: Two semiprivate nooks — one near the front window, the other in the rear — are designed with small parties in mind and show off the handiwork of New York artist John Tsombikos, the sons’ brother-in-law. The 78-seat dining room can also be divided in half to carve out space for larger functions. Another 24 seats dress up the front patio. Without a reservation, I’m content with a stool at the convivial bar.No matter where you find yourself, though, Our Mom Eugenia tastes as if Eugenia were stirring the pot. 4044 Campbell Ave., Arlington, Va. 571-970-0468. ourmomeugenia.com.

I only ask because the onetime Chinese Embassy chef recently launched another restaurant — No. 14. His latest draw unfolds in the Merriweather District in Columbia, Md., and is small by the native of Hubei province’s usual standards, just 75 seats in the blond dining room and 56 items on the menu.Quality and flavor infuse almost every dish. The dumplings are the sort you wish every dim sum parlor offered. “Grandma’s” noodles reverberate with the racy heat of chile oil, minced garlic and tongue-numbing Sichuan peppercorns. The vegetable dishes — snappy and smoky green beans, cabbage and Chinese yam seasoned with five-spice powder — are a testament to the reverence the Eastern school of Chinese cooking has for produce. If there’s a miss on the menu, it’s the wan Peking duck with its oil-drenched, kinda-crisp skin. That means more stomach space for crowd-pleasers like the scallion bubble pancake made famous by Chang’s wife, chef Lisa Chang, and shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce.[Peter Chang’s restaurant empire expands to Columbia, Md. Lucky diners.]The common thread among the sundry Chang restaurants is steadiness. The family-owned enterprise overstaffs in preparation for future restaurants and as a way to advance loyal employees. If the latest Peter Chang tastes as if the busy star were in the kitchen, it’s because chef Yabin He, who cooked with Chang back in China decades ago, is a great mimic 6000 Merriweather Dr., Columbia, Md. 410-413-5887. peterchangcolumbia.com.

One thing that separates this fresh face from the pack is what it excludes — French onion soup, for instance.“A lot of places do that already,” says chef-owner Jeremiah Langhorne, heretofore best known for the Dabney, his love letter to the Mid-Atlantic.[Yet another French spot in D.C., Petite Cerise charts a personal course]Fewer places are making buckwheat crepes filled with salami and goat cheese, a fond memory of the chef’s from a food market in Rennes, or lavishing so much love on sauces. Grilled mussels get cloaked with a ruddy choron sauce zapped with threads of chorizo; asparagus comes with a bowl of frothy hollandaise and whipped cream; and braised chicken arrives in a swell of cream, morel mushrooms and vin jaune, the “yellow wine” with a flavor similar to sherry. “A little extra sauce is almost like an extra dish,” says Langhorne, who buys good baguettes for dispatching the liquid riches.What’s not gleaming white subway tile seems to be friendly green paint; half-curtains dress up the windows, and mirrors and copper molds hang on the walls. The two-story restaurant was designed with a European sensibility. The only snails here are in the logo, subtle encouragement for patrons to take it slow, says the chef.Main courses alternate between cozy grand-mère combinations and subtler French notions. One of the more joyful “plats” is black bass staged for the season with bright green peas, downy lettuce and sunny drops of lemon puree on the delicate fish.The noise can be cruel, especially upstairs. The upside is a bistro that’s open from morning to night, and dishes you won’t find at the competition. 1027 Seventh St. NW. 202-977-4550. petitecerisedc.com.

In between visits, though, I rely on restaurants including Rania to get my (modern) fix.No two reservations are ever alike; chef Chetan Shetty, the former talent at Indian Accent in New York, is constantly finessing his menu. He says appearances are important to him. A gold bowl showcases typically humble Parsi chicken: minced thighs, warm with curry leaves and coriander, supporting a “nest” of shoestring potatoes crowned with a delicate poached egg dusted with a red chile blend. Prick the egg and you get a sunny gravy. Taste is crucial, too. Braised lamb fairly swells with green chiles, ginger and cilantro. Along with yogurt and pickled onions, the shredded meat packs a thin chickpea pancake, folded over the luscious filling like a taco.[Rania delights with some of the most inspired Indian cooking in D.C.]Patrons select three or four courses from among a handful of appetizer-size options per course. Go big, then, and find room for the sweet, roe-garnished Maine scallops, presented on two sauces that call for naan: one yellow and flavored with coconut, the other white, foamy and seasoned as if by the sea.Ingredients you might not expect from an Indian kitchen make their way to the broad marble tables. Oysters, for instance, show up with foamy, chile-and-fenugreek-spiked butter. And the chef is working on a rhubarb dessert. When I spoke with him recently, Shetty was in Mexico, shopping for ideas.Rania translates to “queen” in Hindi and Sanskrit, which explains the regal cooking and the posh interior, including arched booths and slots in the gold chairs for purses and slim bags. Did I mention that the top-notch themed drinks arrive in illuminated glasses? This is a fine-dining restaurant that also likes to have fun. 427 11th St. NW. 202-804-6434. raniadc.com.

Commonly made with oxtail, Sari uses beef brisket that’s cured for 18 hours before being smoked over wood. Per tradition, the stew is accompanied by bagoong alamang, salty fermented shrimp paste. “Filipinos love it. Try it first,” a staff tells my posse. The condiment infuses the stew, which Dungca remembers eating on weekends as a child, with welcome funk. (His grandmother used inexpensive tripe as a base.)Customers order at a counter, grab a table in the brightly lit dining room and wait for the food to be dropped off in paper and plastic, since there’s no dishwasher. Smoked chicken wings cured with garlic and paprika and glazed with an adobo thinned with coconut milk require lots of napkins, but it’s the flavor you remember, not the mess. More prime eating comes by way of chicken cooked in a paste of lemongrass, scallions and Sprite — a much-used tenderizer back home, Dungca says of the soda. The most popular dish on the list is the Filipino street food staple sisig, pork hash made extra crunchy at Sari with fried pig ears and pork rinds in the heap and balanced with sides of fragrant jasmine rice and a bright tomato-cucumber salad.Sari Filipino Kusina enjoys a double meaning, says Dungca, who grew up in Manila and went on to cook at the much-missed Bad Saint and Kaliwa at the Wharf. Sari references both sarimanok, a Filipino bird symbolizing good fortune, and the sari-sari convenience stores of his homeland. Hence the little bodega in back of the restaurant, several shelves of snacks and staples — banana ketchup, prawn crackers, the rolls called pandesal — familiar to Filipinos.Dungca shares a mouthwatering update with fans: His next opening will be Hiraya on H Street NE in the District. Look for an all-day Filipino diner on the ground floor, where the double burger on the ube-purple bun featured at his onetime food stall Pogiboy is expected, and an upscale experience on the second story, possibly as soon as June. The chef says the name of the future restaurant is ancient Tagalog for “fruit of one’s hopes and dreams” and also references another youthful memory, a popular children’s TV show. 6920 Braddock Rd.

It was a joy to return recently and encounter the same delicious steamed buns, filled with juicy spiced pork, that I recalled from last May, and to be introduced to some fresh ideas, including slow-roasted duck leg. A refined version of a homestyle dish, the duck, warm with curry, cumin and chiles, is an example of the menu’s “modern Caribbean” tagline.I appreciate the recent addition of “medium” plates, too (oxtails, crab and dumplings). It’s a way for groups to sample a range of island flavors, says Prime.Oh, the salt fish fritters are dense as golf balls and the servers, while friendly, have a tendency to snatch plates before we’re done with them (one actually plucked a companion’s knife and fork from his hands). But the sticky plantains, tossed with candied ginger, prove a welcome side dish, and the sponge cake soaked in rum, best eaten with banana ice cream, is reason to hang after entrees are whisked away. 2017 14th St. NW. 202-627-2981. stjames-dc.com.

The couple were also reminded of the West Village spots they opened together in Manhattan and figured the 25 minutes or so separating two Italian restaurants in Northern Virginia meant they wouldn’t compete with each other.The owners didn’t have far to look for a chef. The clear choice was Lucy Dakwar, who had worked with Gabe Thompson at L’Apicio in New York and helped opened the original Thompson Italian in 2019. (“I packed my weekend bag and never left,” says Dakwar.)Her menu isn’t a clone of what’s cooking in Falls Church. The chef’s fresh ideas include lamb meatballs, kicky with Aleppo pepper and staged on a tomato sauce enriched with pecorino, and stretchy stracciatella cheese paired with roasted carrots. The heirloom vegetables are topped with what looks like strips of blond bacon but is in fact wrinkly, melt-on-the tongue guanciale, while the cheese acquires its freckles and subtle smokiness from Urfa chile flakes.Pastas, which make up the bulk of the script, are made in-house. Lemony bucatini blackened with squid ink and tossed with sweet scallops sees the most action from my fork, and I appreciate the light crunch from toasted breadcrumbs. New to the script is spinach-tinted mafaldine tossed with a sauce of leeks, wine and coconut milk, a fine vegan option. Dakwar plans to add a few representatives of her Palestinian heritage. Down the line might be shish barak, a take on lamb ravioli with yogurt sauce.The clean design of the original carries over to the owners’ new spot, which opens with a long stretch of bar leading into a couple of dining rooms decorated with mirrors and art on butter-colored walls and lighted to flatter the assembly.The bar weighs in with a liquid curiosity: a vodka gimlet flavored like cacio e pepe. The expected hit of lime juice is accompanied by notes of (pink) peppercorn and parmesan. Sip it fast.

Chef-owner Nicole Jones says she cooks “what I’d do if I had friends over,” which means a crumble of lamb, feta cheese and mint affixed to the side of their bowl with tahini, and sole meunière that brings to mind a top French restaurant.The all-female service staff is friendly and efficient. “I tell them to treat guests like revered family members,” says Jones — and they do, reminding me that hospitality is as much a reason to pick a restaurant as what’s on the menu, recently updated to include a spinach salad made springy with peas and asparagus as well as strawberries and cashews, and cavatelli adorned with lemon ricotta and arugula pesto. The wine list is a celebration of female producers, which is great, but I’d appreciate more selections for under triple digits, pricing that seems at odds with the cozy small-plates theme.[Virginia’s Darling throws my kind of dinner party in Alexandria]The place has its quirks.

The biggest change? “We turned the restaurant into an event space and the event space into a restaurant,” says Spike Gjerde, the James Beard Award-winning Baltimore chef.Woodberry Tavern, a former private room, is where diners can now book one of 22 seats for dinner five nights a week. Knotty wood paneling punctuates the soaring brick walls, and amber votives cast a warm glow. The original gratis “welcome” board is no more. Now, you pay for the spread that threatens to spoil your appetite with, most recently, local charcuterie, cheese puffs, sliced apple, a tiny jar of smoked trout dip and more. Thoughtfully, the menu prices have been cut to compensate.[Woodberry Tavern thinks big in a small space in Baltimore]The original Woodberry Kitchen gave diners a menu the size of a poster. The tavern is a much shorter read, but no less delicious. Welsh rarebit is reimagined as a “vase” of grilled spelt bread capped with mustardy beer cheese. Slicing into the construction reveals a boiled egg and ham inside. You don’t have to be a vegetarian to appreciate the carrot tartare, a brilliant orange mash seasoned with coriander, bay leaf and white soy sauce. The homier entrees — fried chicken, pork schnitzel — call to me most, although the vegetable curry, shot through with fresh ginger and sopped up with roti, represents a delectable, if different, change of course. And if you like oysters, spring for the fried, raw and roasted Ruby Salts from the lower Eastern Shore of Virginia.The beauty on the buffet? That’s a Lady Baltimore cake, an old-fashioned confection that deserves more play on dessert lists. Service is pleasant enough, if less welcoming than at my reunion.

But everyone gets VIP treatment here.

      "title": "Analysis | Key exchanges highlight dicey GOP ‘weaponization’ hearing",
      "text": "There’s evidence that the House GOP was a little less keen on the subjects of Thursday’s hearing on the “weaponization of the federal government” than it has been about other facets of its investigations. And one of the witnesses got right to the point in his opening statement.“You may think I’m a political partisan,” former FBI agent Stephen Friend said. “You may think I am a grifter. You may think I’m a conspiracy theorist. It does not matter.” He said his claims still warranted consideration.This was the backdrop of the hearing, which focused on claims of FBI abuses of power and featured witnesses who alleged retaliation for raising red flags. Democrats have pointed to conspiratorial comments by the witnesses and their ties to a key ally of former president Donald Trump, Kash Patel, to cast doubt on their claimed whistleblower statuses. We learned Wednesday that the FBI recently stripped two of the witnesses of their security clearances, citing wrongdoing.The hearing was a long time coming, as the claims gradually worked their way into the GOP’s “weaponization” push. Friend complained in late December on Truth Social that House Republicans used his whistleblower complaint for “campaign rocket fuel and 4 minute appearances on Fox News” but then “ignored me” in favor of other investigations. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), chairman of the “weaponization” subcommittee, confirmed in September that his panel had had contact with Friend, but Friend’s claims weren’t featured in an early November “FBI whistleblowers” report.More recently, Democrats issued a report noting two of the witnesses have harbored conspiracy theories about Jan. 6, 2021, and other issues, like coronavirus vaccines. The FBI has questioned another’s “allegiance to the United States” over his actions regarding Jan. 6. Friend engaged with Russian propaganda outlets while still at the FBI and called for the FBI to be “eradicated,” a view few national Republicans have embraced.Democrats were a little gentler in spotlighting these counterarguments than they were in a recent hearing featuring “Twitter Files” journalists, but a few exchanges got at how dicey the proceedings were.Friend, the most outspoken of Thursday’s four witnesses, was asked about his calls to dismantle the FBI. When a Democrat noted that Republicans have decried efforts to defund the police, Friend suggested the bureau wasn’t really a police agency.“The FBI — it is my contention that they’re a domestic intelligence agency with law enforcement capability,” he said.At another point, Friend equivocated somewhat on his most well-publicized claim: that it was wrong for the FBI to use a SWAT team to arrest a Jan. 6 defendant on a misdemeanor charge.Since Friend made his whistleblower complaint, we have learned that the arrested individual actually appears to have been a self-described militia member affiliated with the far-right Three Percenters ideology. The defendant, Tyler Bensch, was photographed on Jan. 6 wearing fatigues, a tactical vest and a gas mask, and possessing what the criminal complaint against him labeled as “one or more chemical irritants.” The complaint cites witnesses who say he appeared to have an AR-style rifle on the streets of Washington.Friend acknowledged in his earlier deposition that he hadn’t known the identity of the man or many details of the case when he objected to taking part in the arrest. He also said that owning guns could be sufficient grounds for employing use of a SWAT team.Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) asked Friend whether, given all of that, it was appropriate to use a SWAT team, to which Friend responded, “I can’t answer that with a yes or no.”Pressed again, he referred to the idea that Bensch had offered to cooperate.“My opinion remains to be anybody who has been cooperative and pledged to surrender in the case of law enforcement, including criminal charges … a SWAT team is not necessary for that,” Friend said.Democrats have cast doubt on whether Bensch actually intended to cooperate — Friend cited a transcript of Bensch saying, “If you need anything from me, just let me know” — much less that he promised to surrender. In his initial complaint, Friend did not mention an offer to cooperate, which he has blamed on an “oversight.”Another witness Thursday was Marcus Allen, an FBI staff operations specialist who, like Friend, had his security clearance revoked this month ahead of his testimony.The FBI said this was done because of concerns about Allen’s personal conduct and “allegiance to the United States.” It said he urged caution to others about investigating Jan. 6 and failed to provide relevant information about a Jan. 6 defendant. This allegedly led to the case’s being closed before another agent discovered “readily available” evidence that the defendant assaulted police officers on Jan. 6.Allen was asked repeatedly Thursday whether it was appropriate for an agent to express support for those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. He at one point offered a brief “no” in the context of his answer, but he otherwise declined requests to state “yes or no,” even asking for the question to be rephrased. Ultimately, he said, “You should not be voicing support for criminal conduct.”The final FBI witness was Garret O’Boyle, a suspended special agent. O’Boyle has allegedly liked tweets claiming the 2020 election was stolen and compared coronavirus vaccine mandates to Nazi Germany.O’Boyle in his opening statement repeatedly referred to the idea that the government had indeed been weaponized. Toward the end of his testimony, he spoke emotionally about the hardship he said he and his family faced as a result of his suspension. He alluded to a popular theory on the right about the government allegedly targeting Catholics.“I’m grateful for everyone who has provided charity to me; that even includes a former colleague’s church,” O’Boyle said. “I would name the church to give them recognition, but I’m too worried that the FBI would send informants to infiltrate that church as well.”",

      "title": "Josh Harris’s Commanders deal contains ‘earnout’ payment to Daniel Snyder",
      "text": "Josh Harris’s $6.05 billion deal to purchase the Washington Commanders from Daniel Snyder includes an “earnout,” a structure that would provide Snyder with a deferred payment of an amount contingent on the franchise reaching specified financial benchmarks, according to five people with knowledge of the terms of the sale.The earnout represents a relatively small but perhaps meaningful portion of the overall sale price. Its inclusion in the deal explains, in part, why people familiar with the deliberations of the NFL finance committee last week described the sale agreement between Harris and Snyder as unusually complex.The finance committee raised issues during its 2½-hour meeting last week in New York and continues to have concerns about Harris’s deal. One person with knowledge of the committee’s conversations said this week that the amount of debt in the deal is, in the committee’s view, significantly above the NFL’s $1.1 billion limit for team acquisitions.The committee plans to continue to work with Harris’s group to structure the deal, that person said. But the differing views between the Harris group and the finance committee about the deal’s current form — and its compliance with NFL rules — point to a potentially long and perhaps difficult process that is likely to extend well beyond the owners’ meeting scheduled for Monday and Tuesday in Minneapolis. The deal ultimately must be approved by the finance committee and ratified by a vote of at least 24 of the 32 owners.“There’s a lot of work to do,” one person familiar with the NFL’s inner workings said in recent days.Josh Harris’s Commanders deal nears the finish line but isn’t there yetThe deliberations are playing out while the NFL may be making progress with Snyder on the issue of indemnification, one person with knowledge of the sale process said. The Harris deal represents the only option before the league and the owners for getting Snyder out of the NFL. The announcement Friday that the deal — previously sent to the league as an unsigned, nonexclusive agreement — had become signed and exclusive prompted a celebratory reaction by many Commanders fans.“Everyone wants this to work,” one person with knowledge of the finance committee’s conversations said. “There’s no doubt about that. But it has to comply with the rules. It has to be under the debt limit.”The earnout may have been used as a mechanism during the negotiations to push the sale price above Snyder’s $6 billion target after Harris’s group was unwilling to bid that much. One person with knowledge of the process said the payout could be as much as approximately $200 million, though the Harris group could end up paying much less. The exact business-related benchmarks on which the amount of the payment are based were not immediately clear. The inexact nature the payment amount also signals that the $6.05 billion sale price might not be fixed.The Harris group declined to comment through a spokesman.A member of the Rivkin Radler law firm, writing last year on the legal website JD Supra, described an earnout as “a form of contingent, deferred consideration that is often utilized to reconcile a difference of opinions between the buyer and the seller regarding the fair market value of the target business as of the date of the closing.”Multiple sports financial advisers said such a structure would be common and well-accepted in most business settings in a deal of such magnitude but is extremely rare in sports-franchise sales. The NFL has a highly restrictive set of rules related to franchise sales, and the league generally prefers to deal with a lead owner in a prospective ownership group with overwhelming wealth and access to cash.David Tepper and Rob Walton bought the two most recent NFL teams to sell. Tepper, a prominent hedge fund manager, has an estimated net worth of $18.5 billion, according to Forbes. He paid $2.275 billion for the Carolina Panthers in 2018. Walton, a Walmart heir, has an estimated net worth of $61.6 billion and bought the Denver Broncos last year for $4.65 billion.Harris, a private equity and sports investor, has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $5.9 billion. He owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils.NFL finance committee has concerns about Josh Harris’s Commanders dealNFL ownership rules require the lead investor of an ownership group to have at least a 30 percent equity stake in the purchase. No ownership group can exceed 25 people or borrow more than $1.1 billion to buy a team. And no private equity firms, public corporations or sovereign wealth funds can own any shares. Analysts have said those rules may have to change, given the soaring NFL franchise values, but they are not expected to be modified for this transaction.Josh Harris has a signed, exclusive deal with Daniel Snyder for CommandersThe Harris group believes its deal is in compliance with NFL ownership rules, people connected to the process have said. They say the group also believes there should be no questions about the liquidity of Harris and his investors, given their combined net worth above $100 billion.According to the person with knowledge of the finance committee’s deliberations, the committee’s view that the deal is far above the NFL’s debt limit is a far greater concern to the league and committee than anything related to the earnout. That person expressed the view that Harris and investor Mitchell Rales — the co-founder of the Danaher Corporation — have the financial wherewithal to structure a deal that would satisfy the committee but have yet to do so.According to that person, Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, the chairman of the eight-owner finance committee, has vowed the committee will continue to “work with” the structure of the deal. Hunt declined to comment last week in New York following the finance committee’s meeting.It’s not clear exactly what about the deal’s structure produces differing views regarding its compliance with the debt limit. But such issues can be subjective. When Howard Milstein withdrew his bid for Washington’s franchise in 1999, the finance committee reportedly regarded a $150 million loan to Milstein and his brother from their father as a loan; Milstein’s backers had contended it was equity. That resulted in Snyder buying the team from the Jack Kent Cooke estate for $800 million.The stakes are high for both Harris and the NFL. Harris’s group would have to pay a breakup fee if the deal falls through, according to a person familiar with the sale process. It’s not clear how long the Harris group has exclusivity to attempt to have the deal approved and close it. The NFL owners paused consideration of a vote to remove Snyder from ownership of the Commanders to allow the sale process to play out.The league still must resolve issues with Snyder’s representatives related to legal indemnifications and the NFL’s second investigation of Snyder and the Commanders. One person with knowledge of the league’s inner workings expressed hope that the indemnification issue can be resolved, saying that Snyder “is starting to come around” to potentially agreeing to an approach acceptable to the NFL and other owners.Owners are expected to be updated on the Commanders sale during next week’s two-day meeting in Minneapolis. Several people close to the process said they see little to no chance of the owners taking a ratification vote next week.",

      "title": "Indigenous Australian journalist steps down after ‘relentless’ racist abuse",
      "text": "BATHURST, Australia — A high-profile Indigenous journalist is “stepping away” from his role at Australia’s public broadcaster, citing “vile” and “relentless” racism he and his family have experienced, especially after he made critical remarks about the British monarchy’s role in colonialism during a panel discussion about King Charles III’s coronation.Stan Grant is a well known and widely respected TV journalist who hosts the Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s “Q+A,” a town hall-style show. In a column published Friday on the ABC website, he said that he would finish this Monday’s show, “then walk away. For how long? I don’t know.”“On social media my family and I are regularly racially mocked or abused,” he wrote. “This is not new. Barely a week goes by when I am not racially targeted.”“My wife is targeted with abuse for being married to a Wiradjuri man,” he added, naming the Indigenous people from the central part of New South Wales state.He also criticized the broadcaster for a lack of support.“I am writing this because no one at the ABC — whose producers invited me onto their coronation coverage as a guest — has uttered one word of public support,” he wrote. “Not one ABC executive has publicly refuted the lies written or spoken about me. I don’t hold any individual responsible; this is an institutional failure.”Grant said the ABC had lodged a complaint with Twitter about racial abuse targeting him.His announcement comes at a pivotal year for Australia’s relationship with its Indigenous population. The nation is preparing to vote in a constitutional referendum which, if successful, will establish a representative “Voice to Parliament” of First Nations leaders. The body would consult with national lawmakers on policy, but its advice would be nonbinding.Australia to vote on giving Indigenous peoples a voice in ParliamentBy many measures, Indigenous Australians are more disadvantaged than other Australians. They have an average life expectancy that is around eight years shorter and are the world’s most imprisoned population. Indigenous children are 10 times more likely to be taken into state care.Grant has received a wave of abuse about his comments on the monarchy during a May 6 panel preceding the coronation, despite the fact that other panelists also criticized the monarchy and its continuing role as Australia’s head of state.Grant said he had “pointed out that the crown represents the invasion and theft of our land.”Australians have in recent years increasingly debated how they should view British colonialism. The country’s national day is Jan. 26, which marks the landing of the first fleet of British convict ships in 1788. But tens of thousands also use that date for nationwide “Invasion Day” protests — pointing out that Indigenous history in Australia goes back at least 65,000 years, calling for the date to be changed out of sensitivity and for an improvement in the racism and disadvantages Indigenous people face.“In the name of the crown my people were segregated on missions and reserves,” Grant wrote. “Police wearing the seal of the crown took children from their families. Under the crown our people were massacred.”The panel was labeled “bile” by radio talk show host Ray Hadley, who was quoted in the Australian, a newspaper owned by the Murdoch family’s News Corp. Another radio talk show host, Neil Mitchell, was reported as saying that “somebody in the ABC needs to be accountable” for airing “all this bitterness about our Indigenous history” during the lead-up to the coronation. The piece was one of several in conservative media outlets targeting the panel and Grant’s comments.Realms eyeing a split from the monarchy are mostly ignoring coronationNews Corp. did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. A spokesperson for Nine Entertainment, which employs Hadley and Mitchell, said it had no comment and “would make no assumptions” about Grant’s comments.Journalist Osman Faruqi, who has also worked at the ABC, supported Grant’s comments and criticized the broadcaster’s work culture for non-White staff.“Before I started my first role with the ABC back in 2018, almost every non-white person who had worked at the organization advised me against taking a job there,” he wrote in an opinion piece for the Age newspaper. “They cited story after story of overt racism from colleagues, managers and the audience.”“When I did start, and encountered many of the same issues I was warned about, there were a handful of older, experienced colleagues from non-white backgrounds who did their best to help the rest of us out,” he added. “One of those was Stan Grant.”Sami Shah, another Australian journalist who has worked for the ABC, wrote on Twitter that “half the ABC execs reading this will call him ungrateful and a sook” — an Australian term for a crybaby — “and ‘hard to work with’. The other half will commit to doing better, oversee an internal review, then move on after a PowerPoint deck is compiled.”In a response to a request for comment, the ABC said it “has a zero-tolerance approach to racism in the workplace” and that any issues raised are investigated.In a statement after Grant’s announcement, ABC news director Justin Stevens said the ABC stood by Grant and “condemns the attacks directed toward him” after the coronation panel. “The responsibility for the coverage lies with ABC News management, not with Stan Grant,” he said. “Yet it is he who has borne the brunt of a tirade of criticism.”Grant has decades of experience, including more than a decade with CNN, where he covered China as a senior correspondent. He is also the author of several books including “Talking To My Country,” a memoir and discussion of Australia’s relationship with race. His latest is called “The Queen is Dead: The Time Has Come For a Reckoning.”",

      "title": "Analysis | Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray are winning battle of stars against Lakers",
      "text": "DENVER — Nikola Jokic hasn’t gotten the call from Hollywood to front a “Space Jam” remake, his No. 15 jersey wasn’t among the NBA’s 10 best sellers this season, and he doesn’t have an Instagram account, let alone a signature sneaker. His sidekick, Jamal Murray, has watched the first seven years of his career go by without an all-star selection or any other major individual honor since he was named all-rookie back in 2017. Well, second-team all-rookie.In terms of championship rings, awards, social media influence, global marketing footprint or any of the other metrics used to judge modern basketball players, the Denver Nuggets’ duo are dwarfed by the Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James and Anthony Davis. But past glory and pure fame haven’t mattered at all in the Western Conference finals as Jokic and Murray have thoroughly outshined the Lakers’ stars to lead the Nuggets to a 2-0 series lead entering Saturday’s Game 3 in Los Angeles.In a Game 1 win Tuesday, Jokic compiled a preposterous 34-point, 21-rebound, 14-assist triple-double to outduel Davis, who finished with a game-high 40 points and 10 rebounds, and hold off a Lakers rally. Then, after a choppy start in Thursday’s Game 2, Murray scored 23 of his game-high 37 points in the fourth quarter as Denver came back from an 11-point deficit to claim a 108-103 win at Ball Arena. After the Nuggets outlasted James and Davis, who both showed signs of fatigue under heavy minutes, Coach Michael Malone chided the media for underselling Jokic, Murray and their well-rounded supporting cast.“You win Game 1, and all everybody talked about was the Lakers,” Malone said. “Let’s be honest, the national narrative was: ‘Hey, the Lakers are fine. They’re down 1-0, but they figured something out.’ . . . The narrative wasn’t about the Nuggets. The narrative wasn’t about Nikola. The narrative was about the Lakers and their adjustments. You put that in your pipe, you smoke it. You come back, and you know what, we’re going to go up 2-0.”Despite Malone’s huff and gruff, the Nuggets aren’t a ragtag group of anonymous upstarts: Jokic is a brilliant two-time MVP who guided the Western Conference’s No. 1 seed to 53 wins. Though Denver has never reached the Finals since it joined the NBA from the ABA in 1976, it is engaged in a rematch of the 2020 West finals, which Los Angeles took in five games. The Nuggets boast better balance and more experience this time around: They have won six playoff series over the past five years, including a strong second-round showing against Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns.Jokic, 28, has been the rock, compiling seven triple-doubles in Denver’s 13 postseason games. His deft scoring touch, unmatched vision for a center and physical rebounding presence have flustered opponents, and he has shown significant improvement on the defensive end compared with his previous postseason runs.The 26-year-old Murray has been the X-factor: Denver has gone 5-1 when he scores 30 or more points, including a closeout win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round and 31 points in Game 1 against the Lakers.Nothing was falling for Murray early in Game 2. He shot just 5 for 17 from the field through three quarters and clapped his hands in frustration after several misses. But Murray found his touch in the fourth quarter with a pull-up jumper with 10 minutes remaining before proceeding to hit four three-pointers, including a deep one over James, to put the Nuggets in control.“[Murray] got a little midrange pull-up to go in and kind of looked up to the heavens,” Malone said. “That’s all he needs, and after that he’s shooting into a hula hoop.”Jamal Murray goes OFF in the 4th quarter to help Denver secure a 2-0 lead in the WCF!37 PTS (23 PTS in the 4Q)10 REB6 3PMDEN/LAL Game 2: Sat, 8:30 PM ET | ABC pic.twitter.com/wZ9k5YaUCaFor Murray, who didn’t appear in a game from April 2021 to October 2022 because of a torn ACL in his left knee, this series has served as a grand reintroduction to millions of playoff viewers. The Canadian guard, who first displayed his knack for clutch scoring during Denver’s run to the West finals in the 2020 bubble, iced the Game 2 win with a midrange jumper and seven closing free throws.“[Murray] had his midrange game going, and he had his three-point shot going in the fourth,” James said. “It’s no surprise to anybody. He’s done it before. Only one of [Denver’s threes] was uncontested. All of them were great contests. Two of Jamal’s threes was right in the face of me and [Davis]. The three-point line is what killed us in the fourth, but I didn’t see many [defensive] breakdowns.”Though the Nuggets can’t match the Lakers’ 17 championships or phalanx of celebrity fans, they represent excellent basketball foils. Jokic has been this postseason’s most dominant offensive player while leading the most efficient playoff offense; Davis, in turn, has been the postseason’s top defensive talent for the Lakers’ top-ranked defense.So far, Denver’s offense has won out, leaving Los Angeles looking worn out. James uncharacteristically missed an open-court dunk in Game 2, and he shot just 9 for 19 from the field in the loss. Legs appeared to be an issue for the 38-year-old forward, who repeatedly settled for jumpers after logging 40 minutes in Game 1. James has missed all 10 of his three-point attempts in the series.LeBron blew the dunk 😅 pic.twitter.com/bRvv3lGYGhDavis faded in similar fashion, finishing with 18 points on 4-for-15 shooting and repeatedly struggling to get anything going when Jokic defended him. In the fourth quarter, Davis committed three turnovers and missed two three-point attempts in the closing minutes.The Lakers overhauled their roster at the trade deadline with the intention of giving James and Davis enough help to mount a late-season push into the playoffs. The plan worked better than most expected; newcomers Rui Hachimura, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt have played key roles at various moments of the postseason.What to know about the 2023 NBA playoffs (scores and schedule)Now that James and Davis are facing the first 0-2 series hole of their Lakers’ tenures, the two stars must drive the turnaround effort. James’s scoring efficiency must improve with more free throw attempts, drives and better outside shooting, while Davis must score more consistently, while still carrying his typically heavy load defensively, to offset Jokic’s wide-ranging impact. Both James and Davis must display better focus and assertiveness in late-game moments once the series shifts to Los Angeles, where the Lakers are 6-0 during the postseason.Entering the West finals, continuity appeared to be the Nuggets’ chief advantage over the new-look Lakers. While that has proved accurate, Denver’s headliners have simply outperformed their better-known Los Angeles counterparts, too.“The outside noise is the outside noise,” Murray said when asked about Denver getting overlooked. “We’re used to that. Even when we win, they talk about the other team. We beat the [Los Angeles] Clippers in the bubble, and they talked about the other team. Same old, same old. It fuels us a little more, and it will be sweeter when we win the [championship].”Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

      "title": "Iran executes three men connected to anti-government protests ",
      "text": "Iran executed three men Friday in connection with the anti-government protest movement that swept the country beginning last year.The three — Majid Kazemi, Saeed Yaqoubi and Saleh Mirhashemi — were accused of killing two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Basij volunteer force and  a police officer during protests of clerical rule.Rights groups say the three were accused unfairly, made to confess under torture and convicted without sufficient evidence, to deter dissent. The executions followed “a grossly unfair trial that bore no resemblance to meaningful judicial proceedings,” rights group Amnesty International said in a statement.Three protesters face death in Iran, in year of more than 200 executionsWashington had warned Tehran against carrying out the sentences.“The execution of these men — after what have been widely regarded as sham trials — would be an affront to human rights and basic dignity in Iran and everywhere,” State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said at a news briefing Thursday. “It is clear from this episode that the Iranian regime has learned nothing from the protests.”Authorities carried out the executions, for which no public date had been set, behind prison walls Friday morning, after Iran’s high court rejected a final appeal, according to Mizan News Agency, which is affiliated with the country’s judiciary. Iran typically carries out executions by hanging.Amnesty International, citing “informed sources,” found that interrogators had “suspended Majid Kazemi upside down and showed him a video of them torturing his brother, whom they also detained,” and subjected him to “mock executions at least 15 times by standing him on a chair and putting a rope around his neck.”The three executions bring to seven the number of people put to death in connection with the “Women, Life, Freedom” protests over clerical rule. At least five others remain on death row, according to HRANA, a Virginia-based activist news agency focused on Iran. Dozens have been charged with capital offenses. Rights groups say that an estimated 500 demonstrators and bystanders also have been killed in the protests.The ordeal of the three men drew widespread attention in Iran, as a sign of how far authorities could be willing to push their ongoing crackdown months after the protests dwindled.“These executions are meant to prolong the Islamic Republic’s rule and only a high political cost can stop more protester executions,” Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of the nongovernmental organization Iran Human Rights, wrote on Twitter.The three were arrested Nov. 21 and accused of killing the two Basij members and the law enforcement officer six days earlier during protests in Isfahan, in central Iran. Authorities have accused demonstrators of being rioters and under the influence of foreign intelligence agencies.The defendants were tried swiftly, not given access to their attorneys and convicted without any solid evidence linking them to the deaths, advocates said. One of the judges most associated with sentencing protesters to death found them guilty of “waging war against God.”“The shocking speed at which these men were ushered to their deaths illustrates the Iranian authorities’ flagrant disregard for the rights to life and a fair trial,” Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement Friday.Unrelated to the protest movement, Iran has carried out a “frightening” spate of executions this year, mainly of men from minority backgrounds charged with drug offenses, United Nations rights chief Volker Türk said recently. Kazemi, 31, had a business making copper kitchenware, Mirhashemi, 36, was a karate champion and bodybuilder instructor, and Yaqoubi, 38, worked at a real estate company and supported his parents, according to news reports.When the protest movement spread, Washington expressed support for the demonstrators and piled more economic sanctions on Iran. But some Iranians demanded that the international community do more to hold their country’s leaders accountable.In its Friday statement, Amnesty International urged governments to denounce the executions and to charge Iranian officials with crimes under the principle of universal jurisdiction — by which a state can prosecute certain serious crimes committed in other countries.“Intensifying diplomatic/economic isolation should follow these state-sanctioned killings,” Hadi Ghaemi, head of the Washington-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, wrote Friday on Twitter. “Unless the Iranian authorities are met with serious consequences by the international community, hundreds of protester lives will be taken by their killing machine.”",

      "title": "Perspective | Chaos has arrived in the NBA playoffs, and it might not be a fad",
      "text": "The NBA postseason, which progresses each spring alongside the capricious Stanley Cup playoffs, has always been the dependable tournament. Or the boring one. The drama of American pro basketball necessitates an obsession with stardom over the shock of unpredictability. It’s the reality television of sporting competitions. For proof, look at all the Kardashians in the arena.The game is starting to smash convention now, however. By NBA standards, this conference final round is buck wild. It is historic in its parity: A No. 7 seed in the West and a No. 8 seed in the East have advanced out of the play-in tournament, beating the past two champions along the way. During its 77 seasons, the league has seen random teams scatter surprise runs across all the rampant normative behavior. But until now, it hadn’t watched two teams seeded this low tear through the same playoffs.And they’re not just any underdogs. In fact, we should ban all dark horse descriptions. The Los Angeles Lakers, with a 38-year-old LeBron James and a (somewhat) healthy Anthony Davis, have risen from the 43-39 seventh seed to legitimate title contenders. And the Miami Heat, which has become a model franchise with its iron-willed culture, is a 44-38 eighth seed led by the indomitable Jimmy Butler. Both teams have too much top-end talent and savvy to dismiss.Candace Buckner: The Miami Heat’s MVP may be its coach, Erik SpoelstraThe Denver Nuggets, the top team in the West all season, are the lone No. 1 seed remaining. The Boston Celtics are a No. 2 seed that should be respected as a No. 1 because they have a lengthy playoff history despite their youth. But even though they made it to the Finals last season, the Celtics don’t look like an overwhelming favorite, not after needing six games to discard the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and coming back from a 3-2 deficit to beat the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games.In a league that flourishes by playing the hits, the NBA has found a different kind of familiarity this time. The conference finals might as well be dubbed Bubble Redux because Boston-Miami and Denver-Los Angeles hark back to the sport’s oddly enthralling pandemic expedition to Disney World. But this is neither an old story with new packaging nor evidence to forcefully discredit the asinine notion that the bubble playoffs were a fluke.This postseason provides the strongest confirmation that this new day of NBA parity is sustainable. For the last couple of seasons, I’ve often characterized it as an intermission before the next superpower emerges. But it feels more significant than that. It’s starting to look like an era of hyper competitiveness.What to know about the 2023 NBA playoffs (scores and schedule)If the Lakers don’t win it all, the NBA will crown a different champion for the fifth straight season. And even if the Lakers do take a confetti shower, they’re hardly the same team that triumphed in the bubble three years ago. They have a new coach in Darvin Ham. James and Davis are the only holdovers from that title team. Put all four teams together, and there are just 14 bubble players (not counting injured Heat guard Tyler Herro) who will factor into the outcome this time.The NBA has long been a transient league. But for the decade after James made “The Decision” to form a Big Three in Miami, the motivation behind a lot of the movement was to stack superstars on high-profile teams. The players considered it empowerment. The teams considered it an arms race. Then Kawhi Leonard was traded to Toronto, and the Raptors ended the Kevin Durant variant of the Golden State Warriors’ dynasty as Durant and Klay Thompson suffered devastating injuries in the 2019 Finals. That summer, Leonard joined the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency, and Durant chose an ill-fated alliance with Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets. In addition, Butler signed with Miami instead of remaining with a young 76ers core of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. All of a sudden, the NBA had exited an era of super teams and three-star alliances, rebalancing the sport.Since then, every effort to supercharge a contender has proved futile. The Nets traded a good amount of their depth to build a championship team around Durant, Irving and James Harden. It failed, as did the Lakers’ attempt to put Russell Westbrook with James and Davis. The Phoenix Suns have a pending experiment with Durant, Devin Booker and Chris Paul. But they just lost in the second round to the well-rounded Nuggets, and with decisions to make about the 38-year-old Paul and expensive, ill-fitting young center Deandre Ayton, the Suns need to prioritize role players over headliners.Parity might not be a fad. In July, a new collective bargaining agreement takes effect, and it comes with all sorts of legislation that will limit the opportunities teams with high payrolls have to add talent. Great teams will figure out ways to prosper in the new system, but windows of contention will be tighter. Smart drafting and player development will be essential. The old inclination to clear out contracts and allow superstars to join forces — which doesn’t really work unless Pat Riley is orchestrating it all — will be thorny with reduced availability of salary-cap exceptions for teams well over the cap.Which NBA lottery team needs Victor Wembanyama the most?The NBA is almost halfway through a period reminiscent of the 1970s, when eight teams won championships. But this time may be even crazier because the regular season — full of major injuries as well as ailing or aging players involved in dreaded load management plans — is becoming as much about survival as performance.The 2016-17 Warriors, who went 67-15 in their first season with Durant, are the last team with the NBA’s best regular season record to win the Larry O’Brien Trophy. In the past six regular seasons, the best team hasn’t made it to the championship round. The last four haven’t even advanced to the conference finals. Furthermore, teams led by the past four league MVPs have been bounced in the first or second round. Stephen Curry, way back in 2015, is the last MVP to end the season hugging the championship trophy.The MVP award isn’t a pre-title coronation anymore. And the team most equipped to win in the playoffs rarely dominates the regular season now. Volatility is taking over the sport, and if it continues it will either change the way we judge success or — more likely — cause yearly volcanic reactions when greatness vanishes too soon.Whether it creates a better league depends on the characters navigating change. But it’s an inevitable reality that may be more difficult to break than past systems. Get used to the parity. In the NBA, fickle is the future.",

      "title": "NHL’s Coyotes may be forced out of Arizona after voters reject arena plan",
      "text": "The future of professional hockey in the Phoenix area is in doubt after voters Tuesday rejected three ballot measures that would have allowed the construction of a new stadium for the NHL’s Coyotes in Tempe, Ariz.The ballot questions all revolved around the construction of a $2.1 billion entertainment district on a city-owned, 46-acre tract of land in Tempe, about two miles east of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The project would have included a 16,000-seat arena for the Coyotes, two hotels, a theater and nearly 2,000 residential units, and at least $1.9 billion of the costs would have been privately funded.The vote on the proposal, by Tempe residents, was done almost entirely by mail and reportedly featured high turnout. As of Wednesday morning, two of the ballot measures were losing by a margin of 56 percent to 46 percent, and the third trailed 57 percent to 43 percent. Maricopa County election officials said there weren’t enough same-day ballots left to count that would overcome those margins.“The NHL is terribly disappointed by the results of the public referenda regarding the Coyotes’ arena project in Tempe,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We are going to review with the Coyotes what the options might be going forward. The opposition to the plan was twofold. Some residents decried the portion of the deal that precluded the proposed arena from paying property taxes over the next 30 years, particularly because the overall plan did not include any affordable housing. The city of Phoenix also had filed a lawsuit against Tempe, claiming the proposal breached a 1994 agreement between the two cities that prohibited housing from being built within the airport’s high-noise flight path.Tempe 1st, a group that opposed the proposal, called the result “a victory by Tempe for Tempe. This win goes to show that Tempe residents love our community, we know what’s best for it and we must be part of every conversation when it comes to our land, our tax dollars, and what we value as our city grows.”The election defeat leaves the Coyotes without a plan for a viable NHL-size arena in the Phoenix area. They played their home games this past season at Mullett Arena, a 5,000-seat venue on the campus of Arizona State University that is far smaller than any other North American professional hockey arena. And while the Coyotes have two more years on their agreement with the school — NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told ESPN on Wednesday that he expected the team to play there next season — there is speculation that the Coyotes could be forced to relocate after the deal runs out. Cities such as Houston, Atlanta, Kansas City, Mo., Salt Lake City and Quebec City have been cited as possible destinations.The Coyotes have had a fraught history since relocating from Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1996. They first played their home games in Phoenix at what was then called America West Arena, the home of the NBA’s Suns, where a rink had to be shoehorned into a venue that was not built with ice hockey in mind. As a result, some seats hung over one end of the ice, and fans sitting in those sections could not see the goal directly below. The poor views, which cut down on the number of tickets the team could sell, and an unfavorable lease caused the team to move to a newly built arena owned by the suburban city of Glendale in 2003.The move did not change the team’s sagging financial fortunes, and in 2009 the franchise declared bankruptcy and was purchased by the NHL. Since then, the franchise has cycled through ownership groups and has been a frequent subject of relocation rumors, mainly because of its arena situation. In August 2021, the city of Glendale — which had propped up the team with millions of dollars of public money and at one time threatened to lock the team out of the arena because of missed tax payments — announced it would not renew its lease agreement with the Coyotes, forcing their move to the smaller venue on Arizona State’s campus.The Coyotes have only one playoff appearance over the past 11 seasons and last won a postseason series during their run to the 2012 Western Conference finals. As a result, attendance has suffered: In 2021-22, their last season at the Glendale arena, Arizona averaged only 11,601 fans, which ranked 30th out of 32 NHL teams and was lower than some Canadian teams whose attendance was limited by pandemic restrictions.",

      "title": "Tim Scott makes presidential run official, launches $6 million ad buy",
      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is launching a $6 million advertising buy set to begin next week, according to a senior Scott official, marking a sizable investment as he officially filed paperwork Friday for his presidential run.The Scott ad buy, which would be the largest single ad buy from a presidential candidate so far this cycle, according to the Scott official, includes $5.5 million in broadcast television, cable, radio and satellite. Those ads will begin Wednesday and run in Iowa and New Hampshire through the first GOP debate, which is scheduled for August. The Scott team is also planning a digital ad campaign during that time. The Scott official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview campaign plans.Scott’s early outlay reflects both the challenge and the opportunity he has at the outset of his long-shot bid, in a race where he lacks the national profile and name recognition of others. He is registering in low single digits in polls of the GOP race, well behind former president Donald Trump, who has a commanding lead, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who places second. But Scott has built a network of wealthy donors that allies believe will be essential to financing the effort to introduce him to GOP voters and help him climb in the polls.The South Carolinian, who is the only Black Senate Republican, is expected to formally announce his White House bid in North Charleston on Monday, even though he has effectively been running for some time. In April, Scott formed an exploratory committee, which allows him to raise money and pay for travel. Scott has also made several visits to Iowa and New Hampshire as part of his “Faith in America” listening tour.Scott is also competing against fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley, a former U.N. ambassador.Scott will begin his White House bid with $22 million in cash on hand transferred from his Senate account.While Scott has proved to be a prolific fundraiser, there is already plenty of cash in the 2024 race. MAGA Inc., the super PAC supporting the Trump campaign, has so far spent nearly $12 million on ad buys, while Never Back Down, the super PAC backing DeSantis, has spent $10.8 million, according to AdImpact, which tracks spending on commercials. Former vice president Mike Pence’s allies recently announced the creation of a super PAC to support a potential White House run.Super PACs can receive unlimited funds but can’t directly coordinate expenditures with campaigns. Campaigns, meanwhile, receive lower rates for ad buys compared with super PACs.Scott will be the first — and probably the only — senator to mount a White House bid. He is expected to run on his personal story and convey an optimistic message while attacking the “radical left.” Scott handily won reelection to the Senate in November and has indicated this term will be his last.Following his formal announcement, Scott will travel to Iowa and New Hampshire. He’ll also attend Republican Sen. Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride event in Iowa on June 3, along with Haley and Pence.Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this report.Five Republicans and three Democrats have officially declared they are running for their party’s 2024 presidential nomination, and plenty of others are making moves. We’re tracking 2024 presidential candidates here.Republicans: Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, Asa Hutchinson and Larry Elder, have announced they are running for president in 2024. Here is The Post’s ranking of the top 10 Republican presidential candidates for 2024.Democrats: President Biden has officially announced he is running for reelection in 2024.

      "title": "Josiah Gray made changes in the offseason. So far, that’s helping.",
      "text": "MIAMI — Josiah Gray entered this season with a handful of goals. One was to pitch deeper into games. Last season, he only got into the seventh inning twice in 28 tries.That’s already going well. Gray has pitched through seven innings in back-to-back starts this season, including Tuesday night against the Miami Marlins. He finished with 104 pitches in that game, and even when he wasn’t as demonstrated that he has four pitches he can trust even when he isn’t as sharp.“It gives me that belief in myself that, when my stuff isn’t the best [and] I’m having to grind through pitch usage when my slider wasn’t where I wanted it to be today, I can still use my other pitches to get groundouts, get flyouts, get pop-ups,” said Gray, who noted he’s done a much better job of staying calm and trusting himself in tight situations. “This outing [showed] what future success can look like if I don’t have my swing-and-miss stuff that day.”Hunter Harvey can’t seal deal and the Marlins walk off the NationalsLast season, Gray walked a National League-leading 66 batters and allowed an MLB-high 38 home runs. Those mistakes led to longer innings, which resulted in high pitch counts. His walks per nine innings rate is down slightly from last season (4.0 to 3.8), but he’s cut down his home runs per nine innings from 2.3 to 0.9.This year, Gray is getting groundballs in 45.5 percent of his at-bats, compared with 34 percent last year. He’s sacrificed high strikeout numbers for early outs this season, allowing him to hang around longer in games.“I think I’m starting to really understand about, if I have a runner on first and second, two outs, one out, how do I utilize my arsenal to get a groundball to get a double play instead of relying so much on the strikeout?” Gray said last month about efficiency. “To where I might have to throw this guy seven pitches on the black of the zone when I can throw him three pitches, get the ground out and we’re back in the dugout. So just learning about myself as a pitcher and learning more about the process. Each day is a journey, but I’m really embracing it this year.”Gray has also added a cutter, something he developed this offseason after he realized that just throwing a four-seam fastball wouldn’t cut it. Last season, opponents had a .305 batting average and .742 slugging percentage off Gray’s fastball. Twenty-four of those 38 homers came off the pitch.“I was just sort of ticked off at me going out there, throwing 95-plus, and now the hitters are seeing it like it’s a BP fastball,” Gray said last month. “So it was kind of like, ‘Okay, how can I switch up looks somewhat?’ ”Nationals pitching coach Jim Hickey said Gray’s fastball ran well off the plate to his arm side. Those misses made him vulnerable to home runs and walks last year, especially against lefties. But adding a cutter to the arsenal gives him a pitch that runs in on the hands of lefties. Hickey pointed to other pitchers who added the cutter for the same reason. Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen was an all-star in 2018, the first season he started throwing it. Gerrit Cole, Jameson Taillon and Brusdar Graterol have also added cutters in recent years.But Hickey said Gray is simply executing pitches better this year, too. His direction to the plate — a point of emphasis this offseason — is pretty close to the same as last year, Hickey said. The difference: His back side is allowing him to throw on more of a downward plane. That’s leading to better pitches.“You’re not seeing these noncompetitive-type misses,” Hickey said. “For the most part, everything that he’s throwing is a decision-making pitch to a hitter. At least that’s what I call it. It’s not one of those where as soon as it leaves your hand, it’s like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’ I mean, there’s been a couple of those, but in the past, there was a number of them per game and he’s really, really shrunk that number down.”Gray allowed three home runs in his first game, a deflating start to the year. But he’s only allowed two home runs since. He’s seemed to get stronger as games have gone on. And though he’s been critical of his past few starts, he’s avoided any major damage.That’s built some trust with Manager Dave Martinez. And Tuesday, Gray came through again and kept the Nationals in the game. A year ago, that might not have happened.“I think he’s learned in these high-leverage situations to control the heartbeat and get through it,” Martinez said. “Like I said, today was a big moment for him. He got through it again.”",

      "text": "With just half a minute left in a Stanley Cup playoff game at Las Vegas on May 6, Golden Knights defenseman Zach Whitecloud took a check from behind. It was unnecessary. The game was decided, with Edmonton up three. So Whitecloud turned and slashed the arm of the offender, Oilers forward Klim Kostin, then shed his gloves and began to fight.That was what you would expect of a 6-foot-2 athlete who weighs maybe half a stone over 200 pounds, playing in a adrenaline-fueled collision sport sometimes still governed on the ice by fisticuffs.What you would not expect of such a man was what Whitecloud did a few days later.But he is Native. First Nations. Born and reared in Brandon, Manitoba, a city about 30 miles from the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation reservation of a little more than 1,000 people. He considers it home. The reservation knows him as its son. Its council even picked up Whitecloud’s costs to play travel hockey as a kid. Sioux Valley Dakota is quite proud of its first son to make it to the NHL.So when Whitecloud was apprised of ESPN announcer John Anderson making fun of his name while narrating highlights of the Las Vegas-Edmonton series, he spoke to Anderson — “In our culture, we were raised to be the first ones to reach out and offer help,” Whitecloud explained — and then faced the media about the affront.He spoke haltingly for a little over five minutes. It was painful for him. It was equally agonizing to watch. At least if you have a heart.“I’m proud of my culture. I’m proud of where I come from, where I was raised and who I was raised by,” Whitecloud said. “I carry my grandfather’s last name, and nothing makes me more proud than to be able to do that.”But emotion began to overcome him. So he bowed his head and excused himself from the scrum to seek, as you could only imagine at that moment, some solitude.Sticks and stones may break bones, but it was never true that words don’t hurt. They scorch. They impale. They damage.It has been close to 20 years since the American Psychological Association cited growing scientific evidence as grounds to abolish our very American practice of appropriating Indigenous names and employing our imaginations of Native culture for sports. Its reason? Doing so is particularly harmful to Native children’s identity and self-esteem. And it’s damaging to the rest of us because it informs us that to be indecent toward others is something it never is — okay.But a clinical diagnosis, a data dump, is hard to see and impossible to feel. What was revealed with Whitecloud was real. You saw it. You felt it. It was emotive.“What they did with Mr. Whitecloud was mock his name, which is even worse,” Ronald F. Levant, a now-retired psychologist who as president of the APA in 2005 issued its famous declaration, told me Friday.And how Whitecloud reacted, Levant said, “illustrates the depth of the hurt he was subjected to.”Yet Whitecloud, 26, is in his fifth season in the premier hockey league in the world, where he must play against a franchise the league allows to use the image of a Native man’s head as its logo and a Native name as its moniker.Sports should do better and can do better. But in just the past two weeks, we were reminded that sports can be as insensitive to the marginalized as ever.West Virginia Hall of Fame men’s basketball coach Bob Huggins spat homophobic remarks Monday toward a Catholic university’s fan base during an appearance on a Cincinnati radio station. His employer suspended him three games, trimmed $1 million off his annual salary and amended his contract from a multiyear deal to a year-by-year agreement.Barry Svrluga: With slur, Bob Huggins showed what he thinks. No apology can change that.Longtime Oakland A’s TV broadcaster Glen Kuiper uttered the racial slur for Black folks during a broadcast this month while discussing a visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City. It was explained as a slip-of-the-tongue. Kuiper was removed from further broadcasts while NBC Sports California, which carries A’s games, reviews the incident, which to me sounded as if it was taking the public’s temperature. The internet, always undefeated, found what sounded like a second similar utterance from Kuiper.Kansas City won the Super Bowl again amid protests from Native people to stop offending them with its name and fan hand gesture it calls the “Tomahawk chop,” which Kevin Gover, Pawnee and the undersecretary for museums and culture at the Smithsonian, in my film “Imagining the Indian: The Fight Against Native American Mascoting,” emphatically assures Native people don’t do.And the Atlanta baseball team shows no signs it will stop using its illusory name for Native people, employing a tomahawk as a logo and encouraging its fans to mock Native people with the chop despite Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley, who is Cherokee from Tahlequah, Okla., pleading with Atlanta during the playoffs a few years ago to, just, stop.“It’s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,” Helsley said then. “Just depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren’t intellectual. They are a lot of more than that.”Making fun of Native people is part of Atlanta’s fan experience at its home games. Its executives should watch Whitecloud’s news conference.And in and around Washington, D.C., after all the local NFL franchise has done to debase itself, suck the lifeblood out of its fan base yet finally rid itself of the last chapter of its racist past, some people, including in the media, have raised the specter of reviving the team’s racist old name. Incredible.“With this comes an opportunity to allow … everyone to learn from this incident,” Whitecloud said, “ … move forward and make sure that these things don’t happen again.“It’s just time for everyone to learn.”",

      "title": "Inside the NBA draft lottery room: Heartbreak for the Wizards ",
      "text": "CHICAGO — Brett Greenberg, the Washington Wizards’ baby-faced assistant general manager, leaned forward in his seat, realizing that his organization was now one ping-pong ball away from landing Victor Wembanyama. What’s more, the Wizards suddenly had better than a 50 percent chance at securing the right to draft the 7-foot-4 French phenom, who has inspired breathless comparisons to past teenage basketball prodigies such as LeBron James and Lew Alcindor. Just one more ping-pong ball.In the bowels of a byzantine convention center in downtown Chicago, history came so close to happening, but didn’t, for the Wizards.Greenberg and 13 other representatives were whisked through a metal detector and into a heavily guarded room where the NBA conducts its annual draft lottery an hour before ESPN’s nationally televised broadcast of the results. Phones, smartwatches and other electronic devices are barred from the room, forcing the small collection of team executives, league staffers and media members to track the results with pen and paper. To maintain suspense for the viewing audience, no one is allowed out of the room — not even for a bathroom break — until after the television broadcast is complete.Spurs win NBA draft lottery and right to select Victor WembanyamaThe lottery drawing process is straightforward: 14 numbered ping-pong balls are placed into a hopper. To determine which of the 14 lottery teams gets the No. 1 pick, four ping-pong balls are drawn. The 1,001 possible four-digit combinations are divvied up based on each team’s regular season record.The Wizards finished the season with a 35-47 record, giving them 67 possible four-digit combinations. That 6.7 percent chance to get the No. 1 pick gave Washington the eighth-best odds among the 14 teams present. Teams with worse records had better odds to land the top pick, while teams with better records had worse odds.NBA officials distributed an eight-page packet with all 1,001 possible four-digit combinations listed by team. Washington’s section comprised slightly more than half of page seven. As Greenberg surveyed the list, he realized that low numbers were bad for Washington: None of its combinations included 1, 2, 3 or 4.The drawing commenced with three very favorable numbers for Washington: 14, 5 and 8. With just one ball left to be selected out of 11 still in the hopper, the odds had swung dramatically in the Wizards’ favor. Remarkably, Washington held six of the remaining winning combinations.If the final number selected was 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13, the Wizards would get the chance to select the 19-year-old Wembanyama in the June 22 draft. In that brief moment before the final ball was selected, Washington’s shot at getting the top selection had skyrocketed from 6.7 percent to 54.5 percent. Better than a coin flip.Unfortunately for Washington, a dreaded low number emerged as the final digit: 2. The 14-5-8-2 combination was held by the San Antonio Spurs, who will surely add Wembanyama’s name alongside their two previous top overall picks: Hall of Fame centers David Robinson (1987) and Tim Duncan (1997).“There’s a special relationship between France and the Spurs because of Tony [Parker] and Boris [Diaw],” Wembanyama said Tuesday from Paris, referencing his two countrymen who won championships in San Antonio. “I know half of the country, if not the whole country, wanted the Spurs to have the first pick. Not to brag about it, but I knew what was going to happen. I actually recorded myself saying it this morning, walking to practice. The universe told me.”Spurs General Manager Brian Wright, seated one row in front of Greenberg, celebrated with a subdued fist pump and, later, a wide smile and congratulatory handshakes from the rival team representatives. San Antonio had entered the night with a 14 percent chance at the No. 1 pick.“You’re in the back with no phones and no way to communicate,” Wright said. “That adds to the level of anxiety. The numbers start to come up and you’re searching through the pages to see if you have it, then you realize it’s you. It’s just an incredible amount of excitement. Because of the anxiety, I haven’t eaten all day. If I pass out, excuse me.”Greenberg, who oversees basketball analytics and salary cap management for Washington, studiously tracked the lottery results on a notepad. He understood immediately how close the Wizards had come and recounted the 6-for-11 chance to Indiana Pacers President Kevin Pritchard, who sat to his right.As it turned out, misery loved company: Pritchard would have landed the No. 1 pick if the final digit had been a 6 instead of a 2. Across the room, Portland Trail Blazers assistant general manager Sergi Oliva realized that he would have won had the last digit been a 3.Remarkably, though, the Wizards were the only team to have more than one winning combination when it came down to the final digit: 1 belonged to the Houston Rockets, 2 belonged to the victorious Spurs, 3 to the Blazers, 4 to the Orlando Magic, 6 to the Pacers and all the rest to the Wizards.Washington has twice claimed the top lottery spot — Kwame Brown in 2001 and John Wall in 2010 — but this year was different because of the excitement that has surrounded Wembanyama since his breathtaking performances in two showcase games outside Las Vegas this past October. Since then, “Wemby” has averaged 21.6 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.1 blocks for Metropolitans 92 in France’s top professional league.Several NBA team executives believe Wembanyama’s economic impact on the Spurs could surpass $1 billion during his career, once ticket and merchandise sales, sponsorship revenue and the franchise’s valuation are taken into account.“He will never play in a game that’s not sold out,” Pritchard predicted. “I knew we had one [potential winning ping-pong combination]. I got really excited. We’ve never seen a player like Wembanyama. He is whatever he wants to become. There is no comparison. A unicorn but more.”Oliva, the Trail Blazers executive, wasn’t crestfallen after his near miss because Portland later jumped up to claim the No. 3 pick. When he returned to the lottery stage, he was warmly received by Trail Blazers General Manager Joe Cronin and team president Dewayne Hankins.“You have to go home happy,” Oliva said. “You can’t blame the process or the balls. We’ve got a great asset [with the No. 3 pick].”Washington wasn’t as lucky as San Antonio or even Portland. After missing out on Wembanyama, Greenberg sat and watched the rest of the lottery drawing play out. The Charlotte Hornets landed the second pick, Portland got third and the Houston Rockets earned the fourth selection. That left Washington in the same spot it started: eighth. The past 10 players to be taken eighth range from busts to quality rotation players: Dyson Daniels, Franz Wagner, Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. While Wagner has all-star potential, there isn’t a billion-dollar global icon in the bunch.Seated on the television stage elsewhere in the McCormick Place convention center and unaware of what exactly had transpired in the drawing room, Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. kept a stone face when deputy commissioner Mark Tatum revealed Washington would select eighth. Minutes later, Spurs managing partner Peter J. Holt, pounded his table, joyously shouted, “Let’s Go!” and raced to hug Tatum once San Antonio was announced as the winner.“A little disappointing,” Unseld said. “One bright spot is we didn’t move back. We fell essentially where we were slotted, and we take some degree of solace in that.”Greenberg, a Maryland native who grew up a Wizards fan, declined to comment on how close the franchise had come to landing a savior, citing the ongoing search for former general manager Tommy Sheppard’s replacement. Considering the heartbreaking circumstances, there wasn’t much anyone could have said.Ava Wallace contributed to this report.Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

His defense didn’t help much, either.The result, an 8-6 win for the Tigers, was the Nationals’ fourth straight loss. Their offense heated late against Tigers starter Matthew Boyd, who entered with a 6.47 ERA and didn’t allow a hit until the sixth. Irvin, on the other hand, yielded a leadoff homer to Zach McKinstry and a three-run shot to Akil Baddoo in the third. His curveball, his go-to pitch, induced one whiff on seven swings. He never found a groove, putting the Nationals (18-27) in a hole they couldn’t climb out of despite three runs in the sixth and seventh.“Just making worse pitches,” Irvin said of how Friday was different from his first three starts. “It was one of those days where off-speed is not landing as often and it’s disappointing. … I wanted to set a tone.Ahead of the series opener, Manager Dave Martinez provided a list of injury updates: Center fielder Victor Robles (back spasms) is progressing slowly. Left-handed reliever Sean Doolittle (elbow surgery) continues to pitch every other day in West Palm Beach, Fla., and could do so on back-to-back days in the near future. Reliever Victor Arano (shoulder strain) had a setback during a recent bullpen session and will soon undergo another MRI exam. And starter Chad Kuhl (right foot metatarsalgia) is close to returning, whether that means a minor league rehab assignment or immediately rejoining the Nationals’ staff.Kuhl threw 65 pitches in four simulated innings at the start of the week. But asked Friday whether Kuhl will start again when healthy, Martinez was noncommittal. Kuhl posted a 9.41 ERA in 22 innings across his first five appearances. He often struggled with his command, walking 15 percent of the batters he faced (the major league average this year is 8.8). So when Irvin took his spot in the rotation May 3, it felt like a giant breath of fresh air for Washington.Irvin was more effective and could be more easily projected in the Nationals’ long-term plans. It feels logical, then, to eventually move Kuhl to the bullpen — slotting him as a third long man next to Erasmo Ramírez and Thaddeus Ward — and give Irvin an extended look, no matter what happened against the Tigers. But there is at least one counterpoint.Jake Irvin is an outlier for the Nationals. Here's why.In 2022, Irvin’s first season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, he reached 80 pitches in just five of his 24 minor league outings. Before he was promoted this spring, he topped out at 82 pitches with the Class AAA Rochester Red Wings. Since Irvin arrived in Washington, Martinez has repeatedly vowed to carefully manage his innings, hammering that he is not far removed from a major elbow procedure. That’s easier to do in Rochester than in the majors, even if there’s merit to feeding Irvin chances to build on what he has done well up here. And he has done a good bit well.“We definitely have to keep an eye on him,” Martinez said. “When he’s like that, I told [pitching coach Jim] Hickey that when he gets to 75 pitches, that’s enough.”Only 38 of those 75 pitches were strikes. Irvin started and ended the outing with a total lack of command. He issued a four-pitch walk in the first and third. He faced 18 batters in all, 11 of whom reached base via hit, walk or error, five of whom reached base in the first alone.Irvin’s first-inning error came right after McKinstry smacked his solo homer to left-center. Luis García’s error in the third, the second baseman’s first of the season, came when he threw way wide of Dominic Smith, failing to turn an inning-ending double play. Instead, Irvin threw 18 more pitches — including the change-up Baddoo launched for his homer — and didn’t make it out of the frame. And as far as defense went, Keibert Ruiz wasn’t particularly sharp for Irvin behind the plate.“From the first batter, the home run, he had the guy struck out,” Martinez said of Irvin, implying his final line was misleading because of a missed call in that matchup with McKinstry and the shoddy defense. “I mean, I don’t like … but that ball is pretty much right down the middle of the plate. He gives up a home run, and he could have gotten out of that inning with just one run. A ball back to him, and he just couldn’t make the play. And then the double play ball [to García], that cost him another three runs. That’s a difference in the ballgame.”By sharp contrast to Irvin, Boyd faced the minimum on 34 pitches through the first three innings. Hobie Harris, the first to relieve Irvin, recorded seven outs and was solid aside from Matt Vierling’s solo homer to right. Ward, who relieved Harris to start the sixth, was greeted by Riley Greene’s solo homer to right. Both blasts were relevant once the Nationals stormed back.Boyd carried a no-hit bid to the sixth, facing the minimum 15 hitters through five. Then Ruiz connected with an outside change-up that Vierling couldn’t snare while sprinting in. Two batters later, CJ Abrams hit a double to the right corner. A batter after that, Lane Thomas went deep for his sixth homer of May.The Nationals had life. Before the inning was out, Joey Meneses chased Boyd with a ground-rule double that bounced off the warning track in left. They scored three more times in the seventh, their rally capped by Ruiz’s two-run homer into Washington’s bullpen. But they were already buried deep by Irvin’s rough start, making those late sparks little more than a good sign for Saturday.",

      "text": "The Biden administration has informed European allies that Washington will not block their export of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, U.S. officials familiar with the decision told The Washington Post. Biden has ruled out U.S. deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine, but will train Ukrainian pilots.The decision follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s repeated requests for fighter jets, including from the Netherlands. In February, Ukrainian officials said they had made significant progress in persuading Dutch officials to send F-16s, but Washington’s approval is necessary because of third-party transfer agreements associated with the purchase of the U.S.-made jets.A transfer would require the sign-off of the chairs and ranking minority-party members of relevant U.S. congressional committees. While top GOP contenders for the presidency such as Donald Trump have criticized the scale of U.S. aid for Ukraine, senior Republican leaders in Congress have been supportive of it throughout the war.Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.Europe’s military industrial capabilities fall short of Ukraine’s needs: When Zelensky made a whirlwind tour of Western capitals this week, the billions of dollars in new military support signaled that European governments were finally digging deep to provide sustained backing for a protracted war. Zelensky made clear ahead of his visits to Berlin, Paris and London that Ukraine’s much-anticipated counteroffensive could not begin until more weapons and ammunition had been secured, Catherine Belton and Emily Rauhala report.But while British deliveries of longer-range Storm Shadow missiles could significantly enhance Ukraine’s offensive capabilities, much of the weaponry pledged by European leaders this week is unlikely to reach the battlefield until well after the start of the counteroffensive, military experts say, and Europe’s ability to sustain such support in the future remains unclear.",

      "title": "Analysis | The AL East, MLB’s best division, might be even stronger than you think",
      "text": "The Tampa Bay Rays have dominated this baseball season from the opening weeks, when they became the fourth team in MLB history to start 13-0, joining the 1884 Maroons, 1982 Atlanta Braves and 1987 Milwaukee Brewers. The Rays have won a lot more since then, and are on pace for 120 wins, a total that would eclipse the 116-win record held jointly by the 2001 Seattle Mariners and 1906 Chicago Cubs.Not only are the Rays winning, they’re dominating their opponents. As of Thursday morning, Tampa Bay had scored 122 more runs than they allowed, the highest run differential in baseball and 35 runs better than the Texas Rangers, who ranked second. After finishing 25th out of 30 teams in home runs last season, the Rays have hit a league-leading 86 home runs. Only the 2000 St. Louis Cardinals and 1999 Seattle Mariners had more home runs during their first 43 games of the season. The Rays are on pace to easily break the single-season record of 307, set by the 2019 Minnesota Twins.In almost any other year, that kind of performance would be enough to run away with a division title, but this year’s American League East is far too strong for that. In fact, it seems poised to be one of the strongest divisions in recent memory.The four other teams in the division — the Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox — are all over .500, the only division able to pull off that feat this season. (As of Thursday morning, the AL West was the only other division with even three teams at or above .500.) The Orioles, who trailed the Rays by 3½ games as of Thursday morning, would be leading every other division. But the raw win-loss records, impressive as they are, actually don’t do the division justice. It is even stronger than it looks on paper. Since baseball realigned the divisions in 2013, moving the Houston Astros to the AL and giving each league 15 teams, the combined win rate for the 2023 AL East is the highest of any division at this approximate point of the season (a combined .620 after each team played 40 games). The division had a plus-207 run differential at the teams’ collective 40-game mark, almost double that of the 2020 NL West (plus-118), the next best division since 2013.The NL Central had the second-highest collective run differential (plus-18) at the 40-game mark this season, a mere fraction of what the AL East did to opponents. This year’s AL Central, by comparison, had a minus-165 run differential after each of its members played 40 games. The largest run differential by a division since the latest realignment was established in 2021 by the NL West, whose teams outscored opponents by 443 runs. The pace this year’s AL East is on, a projected run differential of plus-838, would obliterate that mark.Run differential provides a great overall view of baseball’s best teams, but an even better way to judge the landscape at the team level for a single season requires looking at baseruns, a measure of how many runs a team should have scored or allowed given its underlying offensive and defensive performance. The math behind baseruns can be daunting, yet because it removes the effects of sequencing — the order in which particular outcomes occur — from performance, it gives us a better valuation at the team level.Here’s a simple illustration of how and why it works. A team draws four walks in a nine-inning game. If those four walks were issued consecutively in a single inning, it will create a run. But if those walks were spread out over four different innings, they might have no impact on the scoreboard.We can take it a step further and use the expected statistics for each team to derive baseruns. These expected stats use underlying metrics like exit velocity and launch angle to determine the likelihood of a hit, further stripping away any good or bad luck a team might be experiencing from the inputs into the baseruns formula. For example, the Kansas City Royals are batting .234, but we would have expected an average of .249 based on balls in play, per data from TruMedia. So instead of 275 base hits, we can give Kansas City credit for 293 in the formula. Next, we can adjust each team’s performance via baseruns for strength of schedule, also known as a simple ranking system, showing us how many runs per game above or below average each team should be scoring this season. Then it is a simple exercise to rank the teams to get the best and worst MLB has to offer in 2023. All ratings are as of Monday morning.As new MLB rules help base stealers, a speedy prospect tries to run his way to the big leagues.The top team in this expected baseruns formula adjusted for opponent, the Rays, should not surprise anyone. Their performance fuels an estimate of 1.5 runs per game better than an average team. The Los Angeles Dodgers (+1.3) are second, followed by another AL East team, the Blue Jays (+1.0). The Red Sox (+0.7, seventh) and Yankees (+0.5, ninth) also rank in the top 10. (The Orioles are considered an average team by this metric and rank 16th.) Still, no other division has more than two squads among the Top 10, making the AL East clearly the strongest division in baseball.But because of baseball’s playoff format, at least one of these teams will miss the postseason, and head-to-head attrition could take a further toll. Oddsmakers aren’t convinced the eventual World Series winner will emerge from the game’s strongest division. The odds for the World Series winner to come from the AL East are between +250 (wager $100 to win $250) and +300, depending on the sportsbook. The NL East is typically the second choice at around +290 odds, while one oddsmaker, Caesars, has the NL East as a slight favorite. Two teams, the Atlanta Braves (+500 at FanDuel) and Los Angeles Dodgers (+500 at FanDuel), are also given shorter odds to win the World Series than the Rays (+650 at FanDuel).Looked at another way, those odds imply the Braves have a 17 percent chance to win the World Series while the Dodgers have a 14 percent chance. The Rays, with a 13 percent chance, are tied with the Astros.A previous version of this article incorrectly said the Oakland A's are in the American League Central. The article has been corrected. ",

      "title": "Nationals’ bats stay (mostly) quiet as Marlins complete series sweep",
      "text": "MIAMI — The Washington Nationals knew entering the season that their margin for error was small. Forty-four games into the campaign, it only has grown more apparent.Each game of this three-game series in Miami was decided by two runs or fewer. And the Nationals found themselves on the wrong end of all three, with the Marlins completing the sweep by handing the Nationals a 5-3 loss Thursday at LoanDepot Park.“Tough game,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “ … We just didn’t hit enough this series. I thought we pitched pretty good. Just the bats got cold on us, so we got to come back and start swinging the bats.”The Nationals (18-26), as they have so many times this season, came to life in the late innings. Jeimer Candelario and Corey Dickerson both collected RBI hits in the eighth inning to trim Washington’s deficit to 4-3. Candelario stood at second base as the tying run when Keibert Ruiz chased a change-up on the first pitch of his at-bat and grounded into a double play to end the threat.Josiah Gray's new cutter has been a big helpEarly in the game, the Nationals limited their chases against Eury Pérez, one of the Marlins’ top prospects making his second career start. Pérez, 20, showed his talent Thursday but also a bit of wildness.Still, Pérez benefited from a few borderline called strikes, and the Nationals were unable to get to him. A big missed chance came when CJ Abrams struck out with a pair of runners on in the second; Abrams finished the series 0 for 11 with eight strikeouts.The Marlins (23-21) took an early lead when Trevor Williams allowed a second-inning home run to Bryan De La Cruz. Williams left a 1-2 fastball up, and De La Cruz hammered it 402 feet to dead center. Williams then gave up an RBI single to Jean Segura in the third, followed by another to Xavier Edwards in the fourth, and Miami led 3-1.Pérez tossed five innings, and his lone mistake was Candelario’s home run in the fourth. Candelario was one of the few bright spots offensively for the Nationals in the series, going 8 for 11. His batting average jumped from .219 to .253 in the three-game set.“Making good contact, trying to have good [at-bats],” Candelario said. “I want to be able to be in a good position to help my team win, and I got to keep working really hard to keep doing what I’m doing.”Jake Irvin is an outlier for the Nationals. Here's why.Candelario was one of three veterans signed this past offseason to hit in the middle of Washington’s order, joining Dominic Smith and Dickerson. Candelario leads the team in doubles (12) and is tied for the lead in homers (five).Mason Thompson allowed a run in the seventh before the Nationals cut the deficit to one in the eighth. But Candelario’s throwing error in the eighth inning proved costly when De La Cruz reached first. Nick Fortes eventually drove him in with a two-out single off Erasmo Ramirez to give Miami a cushion. And the small details again seemed to come back to haunt the Nationals.“We made a crucial error there late, could’ve kept the game closer within a run,” Martinez said. “Those little things seem to bite us a little bit. So we just got to play good clean baseball. We always talk about 27 outs, moving the baseball.”Here’s what else to know about the Nationals’ loss:Cade Cavalli strolled into the visiting locker room in Miami on Thursday afternoon ahead of the series finale. Later on, he greeted teammates as they came in from the buses. Cavalli will travel with the team back to Washington for the weekend series to check in with doctors. Then he will return to West Palm Beach to continue rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.Cavalli is eight weeks removed from surgery. He’s no longer wearing a brace on his right arm, can straighten his arm and touch his right shoulder. Cavalli said the next step is to strengthen his forearm; his hand still feels tight, and he doesn’t have full flexibility.“Making [progress] with the range of motion, and arm’s feeling really good,” Cavalli said. “Hitting every check mark that needs to be hit, and we’re really happy with the progress. Being back here is amazing. As you guys can tell, I just feel like a new energy. I miss these guys a ton, so it’s great to be able to be around them and watch them play some ball.”The Nationals agreed to a minor league deal with Franmil Reyes on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the situation. Reyes has two opt-outs, on June 16 and July 1, according to another source familiar with the details of the contract.Reyes started the season with the Kansas City Royals, with who he hit .186 in 19 games before being designated for assignment May 8. Reyes has 108 career home runs. If he is eventually called up, Reyes could provide power to a lineup that has just 29 home runs — more than just one other team (Cleveland).",

      "title": "Women’s basketball just had a moment. Can the WNBA build on it?",
      "text": "Rhyne Howard said the quiet part out loud this week. The WNBA’s 2022 No. 1 overall pick and reigning rookie of the year took to social media to express a dichotomy within the league that has frustrated many who follow the game.The league wants to capitalize off the record-breaking viewership from the Final Four and NCAA national championship game. At the same time, some of those players who were drafted after proving hugely popular during those games were waived this week before Friday’s season opener.Howard broke it down:“Ugh, this is stressful,” Howard tweeted in the final line.WNBA fines Aces, takes first-round pick and suspends Becky HammonA consistent goal of the WNBA has been to grow its fan base. There have been positive trends in recent years; 2022 was the most-watched regular season in 14 years, with viewership up 16 percent from 2021. The league just held its first preseason game in Canada and sold out Scotiabank Arena, where the NBA’s Toronto Raptors play. Now there’s an opportunity to build off a women’s NCAA tournament that had the most viewers on ESPN for the national championship game, Final Four, Elite Eight and Sweet 16.“They’ve adopted a new audience to consume their game, and this was not a traditional women’s college basketball audience,” said Phil Cook, the WNBA’s chief marketing officer. “It’s audiences of sports who love competition, love rivalries, love quality of play on the court, love tension. I think there’s a rising tide lifting all boats in the world of women’s basketball that we are definitely leaning into.”Commissioner Cathy Engelbert added: “Now we have to make sure we take these great players and, as they come into our league, we continue to market them, put the marketing dollars behind them. . . . Now we’ve got to bring those fans along with us.”Cook said athlete storytelling — through marketing and the media — is central to attracting and growing the WNBA’s audience. But there’s a challenge in doing so with popular incoming players. The league has just 12 teams and 144 roster spots, and with the limited opportunities, even the top young players can have trouble making teams.Emily Engstler, the No. 4 pick from the 2022 draft, was waived by the Indiana Fever and Washington Mystics recently. Former Maryland guard Abby Meyers, the No. 11 pick in 2023, was waived by the Dallas Wings during training camp. Alexis Morris, Brea Beal and Elena Tsineke, all 2023 second-round picks, were waived. Morris became widely popular playing for champion LSU, as did Beal for 2022 champion South Carolina. Monika Czinano, who was a star as Iowa reached the championship game, was drafted 26th but waived by the Los Angeles Sparks.The list goes on.Not only are these players widely popular from their exploits on the court, but with NIL now a part of the college landscape, many are coming in with established brands and large social media followings. Rabid fan bases such as LSU’s will follow former players such as Morris simply because they’re Tigers. When those players don’t make the league, those potential fans can fall to the wayside.The Mystics don’t think the WNBA title chase is a two-team race“The talent is there. We just need more teams,” said Christine Franklin, executive vice president of marketing at Octagon, a sports and entertainment agency. “From a business perspective, that expansion opportunity feels really ripe given the talent and the pipeline of players coming in from the NCAA. There does need to be some person or strategy to get those NCAA players to the bench of the WNBA quicker. How do those top 10 to 20 players make it that first year? Because that’s not happening right now.”Still, the interest in the WNBA is in a good place and the league had a popular offseason with player movement, particularly in Las Vegas and New York. Many have dubbed the Aces and Liberty as super teams, with defending champion Las Vegas adding two-time MVP Candace Parker and two-time champion Alysha Clark and New York acquiring a pair of MVPs in Jonquel Jones and Breanna Stewart, along with four-time all-star Courtney Vandersloot.Plus, Brittney Griner’s return to the Phoenix Mercury after she missed last season while being detained in Russia for 10 months is highly anticipated. She already was one of the faces of the league but became a national story as President Biden worked to bring her home. Now there will be even more people following her efforts throughout 2023 and beyond.The WNBA also installed marketing deals that give players an opportunity to earn money away from the court. This past offseason, the league sent Napheesa Collier (Connecticut), Arike Ogunbowale (Notre Dame) and Kelsey Mitchell (Ohio State) to attend games at their alma maters and interact with fans and boosters to promote the league.“I think it’s really more on the networks to step in and step up in terms of investment of what they create in and around the playoffs and the tournament,” said Camille Buxeda, Octogon’s director of women’s basketball. “This is setting up an incredible table for Cathy and her team at the WNBA to begin negotiations with different networks [before] the next [collective bargaining agreement]. This is all the leverage in the world that Cathy and her W team can really utilize to take to these networks and help them understand.”At emotional news conference, Brittney Griner mostly looks forwardThat may be the biggest opportunity for exponential growth. The WNBA airs games on several platforms, including Ion in a new deal, but ESPN and ABC remain the largest platforms for national games. WNBA games and the NCAA tournament have had strong numbers on major networks. A new deal after the one with ESPN expires in 2025 should give the league an influx of cash and the chance to get in front of more eyeballs.Liberty and Brooklyn Nets co-owner Clara Wu Tsai recently made the point while discussing a new documentary about the inception of the WNBA during an appearance on “Good Morning America.”“There’s been so little media coverage around women’s sports,” Tsai said. “Even though there’s a very proven appetite for women’s sports, only about 5 percent of all sports coverage is on women sports. There’s just such a lack of storytelling, and I really wanted to bring some national attention to the league and to these amazing athletes.”",

      "title": "Brittney Griner’s improbable WNBA return was accompanied by a sense of triumph",
      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Brittney Griner crouched slightly at the half-court line, leaped and extended a long arm over her lean 6-foot-9 frame to easily bat the ball backward to her teammate. It was one of several movements — the tip-off to start the game — that Griner has performed hundreds of times over the past decade as the dominant center for the Phoenix Mercury.But doing it again, and this soon — in a fired-up arena with the vice president in attendance — would have been nearly impossible to picture less than a year ago, when Griner was shackled in a Russian court, being sentenced to nine years in prison. By the scoreboard alone, Griner’s return Friday to professional basketball, as Phoenix took on the Los Angeles Sparks to open the 2023 WNBA season, was a rout. The Sparks claimed a 94-71 victory, and Griner had 18 points, six rebounds and four blocks in 25 minutes. But her return cemented one of the most unlikely comeback stories in sports history — and one of the most unusual.Griner, a top star in her league, faced a dark future in a penal colony as a pawn in international relations after customs officials in Russia, where she played for a professional team during the WNBA offseason, found vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her luggage. She ultimately spent 294 days in Russian custody before being returned to the United States in December in a controversial prisoner swap for convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Friday’s season opener was her first WNBA game since Game 4 of the WNBA Finals on Oct. 17, 2021.Following the game, Griner, 32, said that her incarceration caused her to “appreciate everything a little bit more” — which included a warm welcome in an opposing team’s arena and a surprise visit to the locker room by Vice President Harris. But the sentimentality had its limits.“Not good enough,” Griner said to sum up the game. “We didn’t get the dub.”The night at times felt like a celebration accompanied by a basketball game. Before tip-off, Griner’s every movement was followed by a gaggle of video and still photographers. Fans waved cutout photos of her face, and the announcer led the arena in a chant of, “Welcome home BG!” Griner motioned to her heart as she received a standing ovation. The vice president walked on the court and waved, and several celebrities, including former Lakers all-star Pau Gasol, Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and tennis champion Billie Jean King, sat courtside. Griner stood with her teammates during the national anthem, a departure from her stance pre-incarceration, when she refused to take the court during the anthem. Her protest, which started amid national uproar over police brutality and racism in 2020, attracted conservative ire when she then required rescue from the American government. Griner explained after the game that the anthem “just means a little bit more to me now,” saying of her incarceration: “I was literally in a cage and could not stand the way I wanted to.”Griner said that she still supports her teammates who choose not to stand for the anthem, adding that making such decisions for yourself “actually makes you more American.\"Mercury Coach Vanessa Nygaard echoed that sentiment before the game, calling Friday a “day of joy\" that made her proud of her country. “We brought home this woman, this Black gay woman, from a Russian jail,” Nygaard said. \"And America did that because they valued her. ... It makes me very proud to be an American. And even though there are people for who that doesn’t make them proud, for me, I see [Griner], and I see hope.”Griner was stopped at a Moscow-area airport on Feb. 17, 2022 — a week before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — but her detention was not reported in the press for weeks afterward. For most of 2022, the American public — and Griner’s family and teammates — only received sporadic glimpses of her plight via images of her in chains or behind jail cell bars. An eight-time all-star who helped lead the Mercury to a championship in 2014, Griner sometimes seemed forgotten — which Nygaard tried to combat last year by starting every news conference with a new tally of how many days she had been incarcerated in Russia.Nygaard said that Griner’s freedom was a result of the persistence of those within the league. “When one of their sisters was in this predicament, this terrible situation, they used their voice and they amplified it,” Nygaard said. “I think it was the voices of the WNBA and the fans of the WNBA that finally got the Biden administration until they said, ‘You know what, let’s make this happen.’ ”In December, President Biden authorized the swap of Griner for Bout, a Russian national serving a 25-year sentence in American prison for arms trafficking. In remarks announcing Griner’s return, Biden said that Griner “didn’t ask for special treatment,” and that her only request was that his administration not “forget about me and the other American detainees.” Griner has since attempted to put a focus on those detainees still in Russia by posting messages to her social media encouraging “everyone that played a part in bringing me home to continue their efforts to bring all Americans home.”Griner’s saga has shed light on the compensation of the world’s best female basketball players, whose relatively paltry pay — WNBA salaries top out at just over $200,000 — has forced even the greatest of them to moonlight overseas, as Griner was when she was detained. And even with all of the pomp for Friday’s game, which was broadcast on ESPN and attracted national sports reporters, the empty upper decks of the Crypto.com Arena did not escape the attention of players and the Mercury coach. “Honestly, c’mon L.A. — we didn’t sell out the arena for B.G.?” Nygaard said. “It was great, it was loud, but how was it not a sellout?”Griner expressed hope that the media focus on her will bring new fans to the WNBA. “Hopefully everybody tuning in to see me now will see somebody else,” she said.Griner scored 11 of her points in the first half but appeared to tire in the second half, and after the game discussed improving her stamina to the point in which she could play 40 minutes if necessary. These are the sorts of problems — basketball problems — that, Griner acknowledged after the game, she sometimes thought she would never experience again.“Me personally, I look at it as the worst case scenario so I don’t get hopes up,” Griner said of her perspective while incarcerated. She then added with a wink: “I’ll elaborate on that a little bit more, just make sure you get a copy of the book.”",

      "title": "Republicans deploy new playbook for abortion bans, citing political backlash ",
      "text": "Nebraska antiabortion groups and GOP lawmakers were stunned. In late April, their effort to ban most abortions was tanked by an unlikely person: 80-year-old Sen. Merv Riepe, a longtime Republican.Instead, on Friday, Nebraska’s conservative legislature voted to ban abortions at 12 weeks of pregnancy — a threshold that significantly narrows the window for legal abortions but still allows the vast majority to occur.A few days earlier, North Carolina Republicans used their legislative supermajority to enact a similar 12-week ban, calling it a “mainstream” approach that would be more broadly accepted than the stricter bans many conservatives had sought to pass. And in neighboring South Carolina, state Sen. Katrina Shealy (R) told The Washington Post that she and the other female GOP senators who blocked a near-total ban are planning to push for a 12-week ban on most abortions when the state Senate takes up a bill next week restricting abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy.“We can’t live at the extremes,” North Carolina Sen. Amy Galey (R) said in an interview. “As a country, we can find a way to take a difficult issue and resolve it without a huge amount of acrimony and viciousness.”Immediately after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republican lawmakers were quick to embrace so-called “trigger” bans designed to take effect as soon as the decision was released, while others rushed to pass additional restrictions that would halt the procedure in their states, sometimes backing proposals that did not include exceptions for rape or incest.Now, almost a year later, lawmakers in some Republican-led states have started coalescing behind bans that allow most abortions to continue — a reaction, some Republicans say, to the sustained political backlash to abortion restrictions that has been mounting since the landmark decision in June.While the 12-week bans have so far only passed in two states — North Carolina and Nebraska — the proposal has also gained traction with some national antiabortion groups who say they’re supportive of restricting abortions as far as a state can, including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which has also been pushing for, at minimum, national limits on abortion at 15 weeks.But the approach has drawn sharp criticism from others in the antiabortion movement, who argue the 12 or 15 week bans don’t do enough to stop what they see as widespread murder, allowing more than 90 percent of abortions to continue. Some Republican lawmakers and antiabortion advocates remain adamant that the only path forward is to aim to eradicate abortion completely nationwide.How voters respond to these new bans could impact how abortion plays out as an issue in the 2024 presidential election. With little polling on the 12 week proposals, it’s unclear whether voters will buy Republican arguments that these kinds of bans are a “mainstream” compromise.Abortion rights advocates are adamant that these measures are potentially just as harmful as their stricter counterparts, maintaining that voters will reject any attack on abortion rights.“At Planned Parenthood our position is that any ban on abortion is going to harm people that could become pregnant,” said Olivia Cappello, state communications manager for Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “Whether it’s six weeks or 12 weeks, an abortion ban stops people from getting the care they need when they need it and interferes with their freedom to decide what is best for their bodies and their lives and futures.”A majority of Americans want to keep abortion legal in all or most cases, several polls have shown in recent months.Yet support for abortion limits increases as pregnancy progresses through the second trimester, which starts at 13 weeks. An April Fox News poll found 54 percent of registered voters nationally favored a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy in their state with an exception for medical emergencies. In an AP-NORC poll, 57 percent of adults said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases in the second trimester, while a small majority — 53 percent — supported abortion rights up to 15 weeks. Many countries around the world — including most European nations — limit abortions around the beginning of the second trimester.The debate over abortion has morphed in other ways since the justices fundamentally altered the landscape across the United States. Last summer, public backlash swiftly ensued over abortion bans that don’t include rape or incest exceptions — terrain least favorable to the GOP. Of the 13 “trigger” bans, only four included exceptions for both rape and incest, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.But that’s not the case for many of the bills passed this year restricting abortions. Measures in North Carolina, Nebraska, Florida, Wyoming and North Dakota all included exceptions for rape and incest in some form, though some are limited by gestational age. Abortion rights groups have expressed concerns that such policies don’t work well in practice.This dynamic is in part because, before Roe was overturned, the laws were designed with the antiabortion movement and Republican primary voter in mind, said Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at the University of California at Davis.“There are Republicans who are looking at this and saying we can’t just cater to the antiabortion and the primary voter because there’s a lot of voters now who care about abortion,” she said. “It may actually backfire on us.”In the months since Roe was overturned, voters have repeatedly demonstrated support for abortion rights, striking down antiabortion amendments even in conservative states such as Kentucky and Kansas. The 2022 midterms, in which a number of Democrats won competitive races after making abortion rights a central issue, were widely viewed as a danger sign for Republicans.Concerns about political backlash on abortion shaped the campaigns of a small group of moderate Republicans running for the legislature in North Carolina, a state where abortions are legal up until 20 weeks of pregnancy and that saw one of the largest spikes in abortions in the months after Roe fell.Abortion had become a defining issue across the state ahead of the midterms, with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) inserting himself into several key races. He filmed ads that cast Republicans as “cruel and extreme” on the issue and warned they would vote to severely restrict abortion access in North Carolina.While a plurality of Republicans in the North Carolina legislature supported a “heartbeat ban” on abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, some moderates realized they would struggle to win their races if they took a hard line stance on abortion, according to a person familiar with internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recall private conversations.To counter the governor’s ads, one of the most heavily targeted Republicans, state Sen. Michael Lee, wrote an op-ed in the Wilmington Star News before the election voicing his support for abortion bans in the second and third trimesters, but not before.“We must find common ground on this issue,” Lee wrote, adding that a consensus “can be found between the extremes while respecting the sanctity of life and allowing for common-sense restrictions and exemptions.”When the legislature convened in January — before Rep. Tricia Cotham would switch her party affiliation to Republican and hand the GOP a veto-proof majority in both chambers — working groups assembled to find what Republicans in the state called a “middle way” on abortion.At the beginning of the conversations, Galey said, some Republicans voiced support for a ban at conception while others preferred no additional restrictions at all. While everyone disliked the 12-week option “to a certain degree,” Galey said, eventually a critical number of Republicans came to accept it.Many Republican hard-liners, as well as antiabortion groups in the state, initially were angry and frustrated, said Jason Williams, the executive director of the North Carolina Faith & Freedom Coalition, a statewide antiabortion organization. The 12-week option seemed like a cop-out, he said, allowing the vast majority of abortions to continue.“Many of those who wanted a heartbeat bill were open to a compromise of 8 or 10 weeks,” said Williams. “Unfortunately, there wasn’t any movement from those who were firm on 12 weeks.”At one point during the discussions in Raleigh, several Republican members suggested that North Carolina put the question to voters in a referendum — an idea that was swiftly rejected by antiabortion advocates, according to the person familiar with internal discussions.An advocate for the 12-week ban pointed out their hypocrisy, recalled the person.“You admit you don’t want that, because it’s not popular,” the advocate for the 12-week ban said. “But you want our members to vote for something that’s not popular.”Ultimately, the antiabortion groups got on board — starting with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, according to a person in the state who was familiar with the discussions. The group had put out polling in North Carolina, as well as in Nebraska, and supplied information on the impacts of abortion to state lawmakers and local antiabortion leaders, said Stephen Billy, the vice president of state affairs at SBA.“Our focus is on being as aggressive as we can in finding consensus to protect as many babies and serve as many moms as possible as quickly as we can,” he said. “In Nebraska and in North Carolina, with their bills, that’s exactly what’s happening.”Democrats have fiercely rejected the idea that the North Carolina legislation is a mainstream compromise, pointing out that other restrictions embedded in the bill, including an additional mandatory in-person consultation at an abortion clinic 72 hours before the procedure, will limit abortion long before the 12-week mark.“The fine print requirements and restrictions will shut down clinics and make abortion completely unavailable to many women at any time — and that’s going to cause desperation and death,” Gov. Cooper said in an interview.Republicans in North Carolina kept the 12-week proposal a secret until the last possible moment, in part to prevent Republican hard-liners from amending the bill to make it more restrictive, according to the person familiar with the internal discussions. Instead of introducing the measure as a new bill, as is typical, Republicans gutted a different piece of legislation and inserted the 46-page abortion proposal, allowing them to move straight to an up-or-down vote and pass the bill less than 48 hours after it was introduced.In Nebraska — where lawmakers are technically nonpartisan but generally have a party affiliation — Democrats and abortion rights groups blasted conservatives for attaching an amendment containing a 12-week abortion ban to a gender-affirming care bill.They described a feeling of whiplash when the one-chamber legislature adopted the amendment Tuesday evening.“It was very emotional, it was very challenging, … it was also just really disheartening,” Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, said in an interview, her voice breaking.Just weeks ago, they thought they’d secured a major victory with Riepe’s decision to abstain from voting on the “heartbeat bill,” allowing abortions to continue through 22 weeks of pregnancy.But key Republicans in the state saw the bill’s failure differently.“It became our job then to negotiate,” said Sen. Ben Hansen, the state’s health chair who was one of the leaders of the negotiations and introduced the amendment. He added: “If we can save 300 babies a year in the state of Nebraska by moving it to 12 weeks, that’s important to us.”After the initial “heartbeat” ban failed, Hansen began assessing whether any abortion restrictions could be brought back this year. Local antiabortion groups described “difficult” and “emotional” conversations about how early in pregnancy the state could realistically ban abortion. And Riepe, the holdout on the ban earlier in pregnancy, spoke at least three times — and exchanged numerous texts — with Gov. Jim Pillen (R), who he said was insistent on getting stricter abortion laws passed.The governor has said he’d sign the bill. His office didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.On Tuesday, the day of the amendment vote, Riepe said the protests inside and outside the chamber were tense, unlike anything he’d seen in the state capital. Afterward, security escorted the members out of the building.The senator understands he disappointed a lot of people, especially on the left. But he believes that he’s been clear from the start about where he stood on the issue.“There’s one thing I’m stuck on,” Riepe recalled telling the governor. “I think 12 weeks is a reasonable number.”Scott Clement contributed to this report.Tracking abortion access in the U.S.: After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion is left to individual states. The Post is tracking states where abortion is banned, under threat or is a protected right. Abortion pills: The Justice Department appealed a Texas judge’s decision that would block approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. The Supreme Court decided to retain full access to mifepristone as the appeal proceeds. Here’s an explanation of what happens next in the abortion pill case.Post-Roe America: With Roe overturned, women who had secret abortions before Roe v. Wade felt compelled to speak out. Other women who were seeking abortions while living in states with strict abortion bans also shared their experiences with The Post through calls, text messages and other documentation.

      "text": "Elena Delle Donne looked Breanna Stewart in the eye, gave her a pump fake from the perimeter, then drove past her for a layup. Seconds later, Delle Donne blocked Stewart’s jumper, triggering a Washington Mystics fast break.As WNBA watchers imagined rich possibilities after the New York Liberty added a pair of MVPs in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, the Mystics reminded everyone that they have their own two-time MVP, and she looks plenty healthy. Delle Donne pushed the Mystics to a lead midway through the first quarter, and they never trailed the rest of the way, cruising to an 80-64 victory in the season opener Friday night at sold-out Entertainment and Sports Arena.The Liberty and the Las Vegas Aces, the two betting favorites for the WNBA title, have been called “super teams” based on their seismic offseasons. After the Mystics dismantled New York in the opener, guard Natasha Cloud took issue with the notion of a two-team title race.“Y’all can keep sleeping,” Cloud said. “We’re confident in what we have in this locker room. And you can continue to talk about the superhero teams, but we know who we are, and we know what we bring every single night. We know what we have in this locker room, and everyone eats.“So we’re not going to be perfect. We’re going to be damn sure close to it, though. I’m excited, so keep sleeping on us. The Mystics’ offseason was more quiet, focusing on finding depth and building a defensive foundation. Nearly everyone put their fingerprints on this game in one way or another.Delle Donne finished with 13 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and the block on Stewart while playing a team-high 33 minutes. Cloud posted 14 points, six rebounds, six assists, two blocks and a steal. Brittney Sykes, the Mystics’ biggest offseason signing, had nine points, nine rebounds, five steals and three assists. Kristi Toliver (10 points), Tianna Hawkins (eight), Shakira Austin (six) and Shatori Walker-Kimbrough (six) all delivered key moments.“I’m not surprised,” Delle Donne said. “It’s our identity as a team. It’s what we’ve been doing in training camp. And we don’t care about the outside noise. We don’t care about the storylines. It’s not going to change how we show up every single day, take care of one another and get the work we need to get done each day.“This has been the identity of this group, just a gritty, hard-working group that loves each other.”The defense swarmed throughout, holding the Liberty to just 26 points in the first half. Sabrina Ionescu scored a game-high 18 points but on 7-for-20 shooting. Stewart (12 points) and Jones (five) were a combined 5 for 16 from the field. The Mystics forced 20 turnovers, 13 of them steals.New York looked like a team with a lot of new pieces that still has to grow and build chemistry. The Liberty also missed some easy looks early in the contest.The Mystics have a true coach on the floor in Kristi Toliver“It was a great effort,” Coach Eric Thibault said. “I thought we played really, really hard. I thought we were really active defensively. They’ve got really good ballhandlers and playmakers, and we forced a lot of turnovers.“The team that we had wanted to be through camp showed up. So that was satisfying.”Here’s what else to know about the Mystics’ win:Mike Thibault has sat in the first seat on the Mystics’ bench since he joined the organization in 2013, but that changed Friday. Thibault stepped down as coach but remains the Mystics’ general manager. So he sat in the front row at center court with his wife, Naci.Eric Thibault slid over one seat as the new coach and walked into the postgame news conference drenched in water after a locker room celebration. He said he looked up once and saw his father yelling at the same time as he was.“I expected more jitters out of him,” Delle Donne said. “He was real calm. He’s certainly ready for this moment.”Jones spent her first six seasons with the Connecticut Sun after being the No. 6 overall pick in the 2016 draft. Stewart was the No. 1 pick in that draft and played her first six seasons with the Seattle Storm.“It’s refreshing, honestly, to be able to play for a different coach, just like a different mind-set,” Jones said. “Sometimes you get so used to a place, and of course you get comfortable, but there’s certain parts of your game that probably aren’t growing anymore because of that.“I really relish stepping into new roles, new opportunities and also learning from somebody else that has been successful in this league for such a long time.”Stewart said she still says Seattle sometimes when people ask about her team.“Change is good, and change is also challenging,” Stewart said. “In order for us to continue to grow as individuals, as players, as people, sometimes you need to put yourself in a different environment. … Also realizing that we want to do something that this franchise hasn’t done and that’s win and really get the city behind us.”The Mystics travel to meet the new-look Connecticut Sun on Sunday at 1 p.m. The Sun lost Jones and coach Curt Miller but added Tiffany Hayes and Tyasha Harris and Stephanie White as coach.",

      "title": "Football bonded them. Its violence tore them apart.",
      "text": "Deep Reads features The Washington Post’s best immersive reporting and narrative writing.About a year ago, a bunch of old college roommates met up at a tavern in rural Nebraska. Most of them had played football at Harvard in the late 1990s. Now they were in their mid-40s, their broad shoulders rounded, their hairlines giving way to the beach erosion of time. But the same nonsense made them laugh: the teammate from California who wet the bed, the kid whose family ran a traveling carnival, the time a traffic cone mysteriously appeared in their living room after a night of drinking.Old roommates keep certain memories locked away, untouched until they’re together again. If football teams are sports’ biggest tribe and produce unbreakable bonds, the friendships grow that much tighter when they involve sharing a refrigerator and toilet.The carnival kid is Harvard’s defensive coordinator now. Another ex-roommate has written jokes for Jimmy Kimmel. One was a federal air marshal until he couldn’t stand the boredom. And over there, near the Herbie Husker mural, was the nation’s leading voice on sports-related brain trauma, the man CNN called when Tua Tagovailoa suited up after a concussion last season and Newsweek interviewed after Aaron Hernandez killed himself in prison.On this night in Nebraska, the friends broke the seal. Stories and beer flowed. Mostly they reminisced about the roommate they had come to bury. He had been their team captain, the best of an illustrious collection of Harvard men, an almost comic assemblage of genes and charm. He had been the soft-spoken roommate. The clean(ish) one. They tried to square it with what he had become. How had he kept it all secret, even from them?When the bartender went to fetch another case, someone pointed out the paradox of meeting at a bar to honor a man who had drunk himself to death. Some social rituals just are, and remaining a member of the tribe means never challenging its code.“It’s just what we do,” says one of the old teammates, Brian Daigle. “At tailgates, at a wedding or party or, in this case, for a funeral.”The bartender returned and passed out fresh cans. A little before closing time, Daigle posed a question to the group: If you had known then what you know now about football, the game that had brought them all together, would you play? Knowing it could be you in the next casket, would you still?Chris Nowinski was driving with his family in Florida recently, about a year after his old roommate’s funeral, when his phone rang. The father of an Olympic ice dancer was calling to discuss the ongoing symptoms of his daughter’s concussion. Then another call: A kid who had played seven years of football needed a psychiatrist. Another: the parents of a Division I women’s basketball player whose coach insisted on playing her despite lingering concussion symptoms.“Almost every car ride we take, we get these calls,” says Nowinski’s wife, Nicole. “A child, a wife, a mother, asking Chris, ‘Please help.’ He has this in his head 24-7.”Nowinski played defensive tackle for the Crimson and still counts his old roommates as his closest friends. He lives in South Florida with Nicole and their daughter and son, 4 and 2, but he will never stop caring about what the Harvard guys think — and where he fits into a decades-old hierarchy. Several of the friends are lawyers or executives or venture capitalists, but the Crimson football team produced only one 6-foot-5 canary in the sports coal mine, constantly chirping about the dangers of his old sport. Nowinski is why most American sports fans have even heard of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and his personality and bona fides are a major reason the NFL grudgingly began inching its concussion protocols beyond the dark ages. When Boston University’s CTE Center wants grieving relatives to donate a former athlete’s brain, it’s often Nowinski who suggests they make the phone call.CTE can be confirmed only posthumously, so Nowinski’s primary objective is connecting those who suspect they have the disease with the vast network of resources maintained by the Concussion Legacy Foundation, the advocacy group he founded in 2007 alongside neurosurgeon Robert Cantu. Some need an appointment with a neurologist; others require addiction specialists and support groups. Many are just looking for someone who understands.“You can’t always fix it,” Nowinski says. “But if I’m able to talk to them, there’s almost always a happy ending.”If his phone stops ringing long enough, sometimes Nowinski calls the old Harvard guys to check in. Scott Larkee in Cambridge, Mass.; Isaiah Kacyvenski in Boston; Daigle in North Carolina. They catch up, talk about the Crimson’s chances next season, do what you do for a taste of that fleeting magic of being 20.No one can explain this now, but for a long time and probably for many reasons, there was one topic they never discussed.Whenever the apartment door opened back then, the polyphony of funk included hints of day-old pizza, mangled chicken parts and sweat. So much sweat. One summer, they had to lay down cardboard in Nowinski’s car so they wouldn’t soak through the upholstery.Nowinski was 285 pounds. Tight end Chris Eitzmann was a sturdy 250. The runt, Larkee, was 225. Some years a dozen football players piled into the same suite, competing for microwave space and arguing over whose turn it was to empty the trash, which was usually overflowing with beer cans and animal bones.“They weren’t barbarians,” says Mikaela Eitzmann, the tight end’s college girlfriend and eventual wife. “But the whole place was definitely like a closet door that had shut some socks inside for a while.”This being Harvard, football players weren’t exactly NFL-or-bust meatheads. Sure, they would deliberately eat foods they knew wouldn’t agree with them just to wage gastrointestinal war on the others. And, yes, survival and acceptance meant an onslaught of insults. Daigle was the great Texas pontificator. Alex Garcia was the slovenly Californian who showed affection to friends by choking them. Nowinski was the suburban Chicagoan who serenaded his roommates, whether they liked it or not, with favorites from when he played Diesel in his high school performance of “West Side Story.”When you’re a JetIf the spit hits the fanYou got brothers aroundYou’re a family man.Eitzmann mostly rolled his eyes. The roommates never had much ammo on him, other than him being a slow-talking plowboy. He had grown up alongside the corn stalks and milo husks of Hardy, Neb., population 179, contemplating a future beyond the plains.He was tall and blond, with piercing blue eyes and a layer of wide-eyed innocence the other players couldn’t crack. Eitzmann tutored classmates and rarely missed Sunday services at University Lutheran on Harvard Square. He turned down a roster spot with the mighty Nebraska Cornhuskers to become the first graduate of his high school to enroll at an Ivy League school. This made him a local celebrity and heartthrob, so when Mikaela graduated from high school a year after Eitzmann, she moved east to enroll at Boston College.“I was young and had a crush,” she says, “probably like all girls did within a 100-mile radius.”He drank beer, but nobody remembers him losing control or puking on the sofa. Other roommates, sure. But Eitz? He had too many things he wanted to accomplish, this spit-shined drive that pushed away temptation and muffled the pressure of being the first Nebraskan to suit up for the Crimson varsity since the 1960s.“Even his swear words were wholesome,” says Will Burke, Eitzmann’s first Harvard roommate. “It was like Superman landed on Earth and was like, ‘I’ve got to figure out these Earthlings,’ and he just crushes it.”The practice field is where he went into Cyborg Mode, blasting into defenders at every turn. Nobody thought much about concussions then, and there was nobody to warn players about long-term effects or urging them to sit out. Getting your bell rung was a badge of honor, every hit part of a daily competition for masculinity and bragging rights.“If I didn’t come off the line as fast and strong as I could, I was losing,” says Daigle, a defensive end who often squared off against Eitzmann. “I was hitting people with the front of my head as often as I could.”Two days after Yale beat Harvard in 1998, the team gathered in Boston for its annual postseason banquet. Among Harvard’s many traditions is a particularly sacred one: Since 1873, football players have voted on one teammate as captain, the locker room’s leader and a symbol representing more than just talent. Joe Azelby, Dan Jiggetts and Ryan Fitzpatrick are among the luminaries.The underclassmen wrote names on slips of paper and passed them to the coaches. That night Coach Tim Murphy announced Christopher John Eitzmann as captain of the 1999 Harvard Crimson.“First of all, how in the world did I ever get to Harvard?” Eitzmann told a Nebraska newspaper reporter later. “I never could have dreamed all this would have happened to me.”There was no honorary kegger or roommates-only whiskey toast — not for Eitz. All anyone remembers is the pride that one of them, the obvious one, had made it. It was a feeling they knew they would be talking about — and probably ribbing him about — when they returned to campus as old men, their bond everlasting and shatterproof.When you’re a JetYou’re a Jet all the wayFrom your first cigaretteTo your last dyin’ day.The friends scattered after graduation: Larkee to Paris to play for a club football team, Burke to Hollywood to try comedy, Daigle back home to guard the Texas-Mexico line for the Border Patrol.Eitzmann did what they all expected: overachieved and earned a roster spot with the New England Patriots. He moved in with two new roommates not far from Foxboro Stadium. Defensive end David Nugent was all right, but what a stiff the other guy was. When Burke visited, he pleaded with Eitzmann to keep their plans secret from Tom Brady, a robotic and humorless rookie quarterback.“Let’s ditch this f---ing loser,” Burke says he insisted more than once. “God, he was boring.”A thousand miles south, Nowinski was searching for a place of his own. He had worked for a pharmaceutical consulting firm in Boston his senior year, but he wasn’t passionate about it. A colleague suggested that with his size, athleticism and big personality, he would make a great pro wrestler. Before Harvard, he had never followed the sport. But his roommates did, and during wrestling’s late-1990s golden age, Monday nights belonged not to the NFL’s weekly prime-time game but to Stone Cold Steve Austin, D-Generation X and the New World Order.Nowinski enrolled in wrestling school in Atlanta and landed a spot on a reality show in which the winner received a contract with WWE. Two contestants were named Chris, so producers called Nowinski “Chris Harvard.” He finished second but earned a spot anyway and made his televised debut in 2002, playing the role of an elitist pretty boy in a Harvard letterman’s jacket.He insulted the audience’s intelligence, thrashed competitors with a book of quotes, delighted in the crowd’s chants of “Har-vard sucks! Har-vard sucks!”“He got a taste of being the bad guy and just loved it,” says Kacyvenski, a former Crimson linebacker who was the only former roommate drafted by an NFL team.Nowinski got his buddies free tickets and backstage passes. They watched as he took a “Singapore cane” to the face, a power bomb from the Undertaker, a beatdown from Scott Steiner after Nowinski criticized the Iraq War during an in-ring political debate. It was all scripted, of course, but Nowinski occasionally took real bumps and bruises with him to the bar afterward. Still, as he greeted fans and signed autographs, a few longtime friends believed he had never been happier.During a match in 2003, Nowinski charged toward an opponent named Bubba Ray Dudley, expecting the painless kick they had rehearsed. But he reached the corner an instant early, catching Dudley’s boot just under his chin. He crumpled to the mat and felt pain ripping through his head. He’s still not sure what happened next.A trainer asked whether he was okay, and Nowinski lied and said he was fine. Later, he lay on the locker room floor for a half-hour and again told the trainer he was okay. Days passed. WWE’s next show was in New York, and he was still experiencing nausea and memory loss. There were no concussion protocols then, in wrestling or anywhere. Nowinski planned to report his symptoms to WWE’s medical team, but upon arriving and seeing wrestlers being treated for “real injuries,” he says of knee and back and shoulder problems, he left, kept silent and prepared for the night’s match, which he lost after being dropped through a table.He just lived with it because that’s just what you did. Wrestling legends didn’t complain; they jumped off cages and spit out cracked teeth. Football players didn’t sit out because they saw stars after a big hit; they modeled their games after Jack Tatum’s and Ronnie Lott’s because that earned you a spot on highlight montages and a bust in Canton, Ohio. A man didn’t tell his bosses or even his friends that he was in agony because that meant he was soft.“I’m not going to tell them I had a headache,” he says. “I just didn’t want to say anything.”One night in 2003, Nowinski was in Indianapolis when he saw his then-girlfriend falling and leaped forward to catch her. But Nowinski was actually asleep, acting out a dream in a hotel room. His brain was so injured it was conjuring visions without waking him. When his eyes opened, he had no idea why there was broken glass on the floor, why the nightstand was busted, why he had been clawing at the wall as his girlfriend sat on the bed crying, horrified by what she had seen.For years after they graduated, the roommates would return to Cambridge each fall. A few would pound beers at Harvard football tailgates, do shots, sip from a flask. Never Eitzmann. He was the Golden Boy, just sickeningly perfect. Even after a hip injury ended his NFL career in 2002, he came out on top.He married Mikaela, completed his master’s requirements at Dartmouth, got a job as a hedge fund manager in Boston. The couple had their first son, and three more children would follow, all healthy and beautiful. They adopted a Vizsla, went on ski trips to New Hampshire, bought a six-bedroom house in Wellesley, Mass., and a cabin overlooking New Hampshire’s Squam Lake. Eitzmann raced bicycles on weekends, went elk hunting in Colorado, kept Mikaela laughing and never feeling unsafe, a live-action postcard from a utopian life.“The dream couple,” Nicole Nowinski says. “These beautiful people with the beautiful love story, and they were both so humble and lovely. They really were these Harvard Barbies.”Chris Nowinski’s path had become rockier. He never wrestled again. He had nightmares and dizziness, and if his heart rate increased, a wave of nausea would hit. He became sensitive to bright lights and friends who asked when he would return to the ring. Doctor visits alternated between confusing and pointless, with Nowinski being assured his symptoms would disappear. Weeks, though, became months. Depression set in.Eventually, in 2003, a friend with WWE got him an appointment with Cantu, the renowned Boston-area neurosurgeon whose analysis of a concussion was different from that of the NFL. The league office at the time considered it a singular, “trauma-induced” event. Cantu, though, believed a concussion was less an injury than the first link in a longer chain of mental malfunction — a continuing process in which cells experience an outage and hastily attempt to rewire themselves and get back online as quickly as possible. This can take weeks or even months. When the new connection is made, the injured neurons and nerve cells are abandoned, left to die by the brain’s own survival blueprint. With enough injuries, the brain can become a graveyard of scar tissue that can cause chronic symptoms and dramatically alter judgment and behavior.1/3Cantu asked Nowinski how many concussions he had had. He had no idea. Zero? He had never been formally diagnosed, neither at Harvard nor by WWE. So Cantu asked whether he had ever blacked out, had double vision, felt dizziness after a hit, gotten his bell rung? Nowinski thought back and counted more than a half-dozen such instances. Potentially far more.“I had been banging my head for 19 years without any real consideration for what it could be doing to me,” Nowinski says. Cantu diagnosed Nowinski with post-concussion syndrome, and Nowinski says some effects never went away. He and Cantu kept talking.“Shouldn’t athletes know about this?” Nowinski asked.“People don’t listen to doctors,” Cantu said.“Maybe I’ll take a crack.”Now set adrift professionally, Nowinski spent his newfound free time reading concussion studies and interviewing athletes and doctors. He analyzed the work of Bennet Omalu, the controversial pathologist who discovered unusual protein buildup in NFL legend Mike Webster’s brain, the first link between football and CTE. Nowinski compiled his findings into what would become a book titled “Head Games.”As he wrote, Nowinski called his former Harvard teammates to share his discoveries and ask for their experiences. Some were intrigued. Others, not so much. The NFL disputed Omalu’s findings, with a league-appointed neurologist saying Webster died not because of brain trauma but because he had been a smoker, suffered from depression and been in generally poor health. Omalu also found evidence of CTE in the brains of former NFL players Justin Strzelczyk, Terry Long and Andre Waters, the latter two of whom died by suicide.“Just because [suicide] happened to a few football players,” the league’s top concussion expert, neurologist Ira Casson, said in 2007, “doesn’t mean it’s linked to football.”So, Nowinski’s old roommates wondered, why was he attacking the game? Was he so bitter that he hadn’t gotten a shot at the NFL that he was going to bring down the entire sport? Or was this just Nowinski the heel, an attempt to regain his bygone WWE attention?“To put it bluntly,” Mikaela says, “I think everybody thought it was bulls--t.”One former roommate refused to read an early draft of his manuscript. Another accepted a copy but never opened it. Larkee, by then a coach at Harvard, had no interest. So when he and Nowinski talked, they just avoided the topic and suppressed their feelings. If Nowinski brought it up, Larkee walked away.“I’m right there with these young college-aged kids, putting them through tackling reps, so we could have had that conversation: ‘What are we doing? What’s the best thing for these guys?’ ” Larkee says now. “But I think we both know we would disagree on pretty much everything.”At the Harvard tailgate in 2006, not long after “Head Games” was published, Nowinski brought books to give friends gathered around a fire. Many rolled their eyes at Nowinski being Nowinski, proselytizing about the evils of football at a football tailgate to a bunch of ex-football players.“He was screaming,” Daigle says. “But nobody was listening.”Daigle had helped Nowinski edit chapters of his manuscript and grown curious about his former roommate’s conclusions. Daigle’s father and grandfather both played college football; his grandpa died of Alzheimer’s disease, and his father is 72 and has dementia, Daigle says.“How much of that is genetic? How much of that is football?” Daigle says. “My future is definitely clouded by, what have I done to myself?”He would regret this later, but Daigle climbed into the bed of a pickup during the Harvard tailgate. Emboldened by a few beers and the promise of a laugh from his ex-teammates, he raised a copy of Nowinski’s book. Has anyone here suffered a concussion? he asked. Should any of this spell the end of football?Then Daigle climbed down, took another long pull off his beer and tossed the book into the fire.The Eitzmanns loved Halloween. One year they dressed as a 1920s gangster and flapper, Mikaela in a dark suit and fedora, Chris in a sequined dress and heels. Mikaela carefully applied his mascara. Another year, he was Wilt Chamberlain, short-shorts challenging the limits of comfort and decency.In 2008, Chris dressed as Axl Rose, but because Mikaela had to watch Coen, their infant son, before her nursing shift the next morning, she skipped the Halloween party at a bar in Boston. At 3 a.m., Chris still wasn’t home. He didn’t answer Mikaela’s calls. She called hospitals and police departments, eventually learning her husband had been arrested for drunken driving.When he got home, Chris made excuses. He hadn’t had that much. The officer was just a jerk. All he had really done was roll through a stop sign.Chris was a social drinker, Mikaela says now, but he was always in control. He had never put himself or anyone else in danger. But was that true? Had she spent years ignoring signs of a worsening problem?“He was so good at telling me, ‘I’m all right, I’m all right,’ ” she says.Now on alert, Mikaela began to notice lipstick on his shirt and charges for $500-a-night hotel rooms. He would disappear to the lake house sometimes, claiming he needed to focus on work. Why couldn’t Mikaela understand that? Why wouldn’t she give him space? He couldn’t be reached for hours or days, again saying he needed to work late.“He was slowly unraveling,” she says, “and I just didn’t see it.”She ignored evidence Chris had been with another woman because, she says, it wasn’t worth the explosion. She waited until after he had coached Coen’s flag football game one morning to tell Chris his breath was a thick fog of rum. He calmly walked into their baby daughter’s room that day, gave her a hug and drove away. An hour later, Chris called and said he was in a hotel in Woburn, a half-hour north, about to kill himself.“I was paralyzed,” Mikaela says. “I had no idea what to do. No one would believe me. Who would believe me?”She called the police, who took him into custody and tested his blood alcohol concentration. It was 0.44, Mikaela says. When a taxi later dropped him off, Chris apologized, hugged Mikaela and begged her not to tell anyone. When she agreed, he put on his suit and left for work carrying a bottle of wine. A gift for his assistant, he assured his wife.“I didn’t really believe that, but I was so terrified of making him mad,” Mikaela says. “I feel like this major wuss, and I’m really not like that. But I just loved him so much, so I wanted our marriage to be okay and I wanted him to be okay, so I just talked myself into believing him and believing it was all going to be okay.”Months could pass without arguments or threats, a sign Chris was improving. Mikaela kept telling herself that. Their life was peaceful, loving, as perfect as everyone believed. She told herself that, too. They went to Harvard alumni events and socialized with old friends. If Chris had alcohol on his breath, Mikaela just smiled and kept their secret. Then one day in 2016, when Chris was 39, he came home and announced that he was planning to drive off a bridge. Another time he said he was going to Colorado to veer off an embankment.After Mikaela’s father died in 2017, they agreed to go home to Nebraska and take over the family farm. A change would be good for them. Then, in 2019, Chris got drunk and buckled the kids into the car to go boating, and Mikaela stopped him. She insisted he enter rehab, and he agreed to report to a facility in Arizona. They flew there together, Chris in the window seat and Mikaela on the aisle, and soon after takeoff, Chris fell asleep as the two held hands.Fighting tears, Mikaela unlocked her phone and took a picture. This, of their clasped hands, would be the “before” photo, back when things got crazy that one time. She told herself a dream life built once could also be rebuilt. Soon Chris would be sober and recalibrated, and they would be smiling in their next picture together, their bond stronger for this, and looking happy, just as they always had.Rehab doesn’t always work the first time, and for Eitzmann it didn’t work the second, third or fourth times, either. He would commit to it, get on a plane, then discharge himself or escape after a few days and go looking for a bar. Then he would come home.As a way to cope, Mikaela and their preteen son, Coen, developed a code for when Chris was drunk. It wasn’t Dad who would come through the door. It was “Earl.” And they must tread carefully because Earl might get loaded and go driving. He might threaten suicide or slide a pan of fish sticks into the oven and pass out.“Earl still had Chris’s memories, and he still had Chris’s desire to be part of a family. Chris was still in there, so we had to protect Chris,” Mikaela says. “We couldn’t make him upset, because then Earl might leave for good and Chris might never come back.”Mikaela and Coen hid Earl’s credit cards and keys, but he always found them. He accumulated five DWIs and would later fly to Boston to meet up with a woman he had met in rehab. He would spend $6,000 on a vacation to Costa Rica but never go, or he would disappear without announcement and sleep in a camper near the Kansas line.CTE had by then become ubiquitous, and an alarming number of former NFL players — Dave Duerson, Junior Seau, Aaron Hernandez — had taken their lives after unexplained behavioral changes. The NFL had implemented new rules to protect players from the most devastating hits, but for families across the country, the damage was done. Mikaela read about their symptoms, about the mysterious spirals that now felt familiar, and didn’t Chris complain years earlier of headaches and dizziness? Had he been experiencing depression when he refused to get out of bed all day? Had she ignored these signs, too?One evening on the sofa, Mikaela told her husband they could get through this — whatever this was — together. She suggested they call Nowinski, his old roommate. By then he had a doctoral degree in behavioral neuroscience and had testified before Congress; he had been nominated for Sports Illustrated’s sportsperson of the year in 2010 and ultimately pressured the NFL into acknowledging, for the first time in 2016, the connection between football and CTE.Nowinski was also a longtime family friend, so obviously he would be willing to —“I’ve taken care of it,” he said.But this was Earl, not Chris, and this is how fiendish he could be. Mikaela wanted to believe him when he said he already had spoken with Nowinski, and so she did. As she did when her husband claimed he had visited Nowinski in Boston and been put through a battery of tests and even an MRI exam. Nowinski had assured him, he insisted, that all of it had come back clean.There were two dozen former teammates on the group text, but when it came down it, only three could make it to Nebraska on short notice. So one day in January 2021, Larkee, Joe Mattson and Ryan Kauppila formed what they playfully called “The Extraction Team.” Their all-too-serious mission: Get Eitzmann to his fifth — and hopefully final — stint in rehab.Mikaela had finally broken. She could no longer believe her husband’s lies — or the ones she had told herself. But a side effect of covering for Eitzmann all these years was that now nobody believed how bad things really were. His work friends in Boston distanced themselves. Eitzmann’s parents and siblings accused Mikaela of giving up too early. Chris was gaining weight, looking good, getting better.“No, he’s not; he’s really bad,” Mikaela says she told them.“Because I had kept it a secret for so long, there was just no way I was ever going to get him the help he needed,” she says.So when Eitzmann needed one final assist, it was the old roommates who came through. One picked up the tab for the treatment. Another, a lawyer, checked state laws and arranged for Eitzmann to be admitted to the facility. Others chipped in money for gas and food, and a few more plotted the quickest route from Omaha to Boston.The evening before the Extraction Team deployed, the roommates remained skeptical that things were as dire as Mikaela had indicated. “I was completely in the dark,” Burke says, “because he wanted me to be.”When Eitzmann emerged from a restaurant alongside his parents, the trio almost didn’t recognize him. The muscular tight end was gone. In his place was a gaunt and pale figure wearing clothes that swallowed him.“A bag of bones,” Larkee says.They set off in a rented Tahoe, toward Des Moines and Chicago. The plan was to stop only for essentials. But the rehab place said that someone with Eitzmann’s level of dependency couldn’t just go 24 hours with zero alcohol. So, counterintuitive as it seemed, the friends were advised to limit him — but to let him drink.The friends talked trash, laughed at old stories, pointed out how fat and bald and gray they had become. Eitzmann alternated between grand proclamations about getting his family back and questions about his friends’ children and jobs. He talked to Larkee about the Crimson’s hopes against Yale the following season.“The exact normal Chris,” Mattson says. “There was some joy of being together and feeling the real love that existed between all of us.”They were somewhere in Ohio when Eitzmann fell quiet. He was sweating, and a tremor in his hand spread throughout his body. The Tahoe parked at a store, and Larkee had to physically block Eitzmann from going inside. Instead, Mattson and Kauppila went in and returned with cans of high-test hard lemonade. Eitzmann drained them, his tremor eased, and eventually he went to sleep.“We were all thinking: Just f---ing keep driving,” Mattson says. “Take a deep breath, keep the doors locked and see what happens when he wakes up.”After 24 intense hours, the SUV stopped outside a hospital in Brighton, Mass., just three miles from their old Harvard apartment. Someone came to help Eitz inside, and the three ex-roommates watched him disappear from within the idling SUV. They waited a while, the three of them, in case their friend tried to make a run for it, joking about who was still athletic enough to make a tackle.The 126th captain of Harvard football died alone, surrounded by bottles, on the couch of his $3,500-a-month apartment in South Boston. The medical examiner determined that Eitzmann’s heart and liver gave out, no longer able to defend against a daily assault of alcohol.Mikaela had last heard his voice five days earlier, when the kids called him on Christmas Eve. Eitzmann was slurring and unintelligible, and he ended the call after speaking with only two of his four children. That fifth rehab stint had ended almost immediately, after Eitzmann tested positive for the coronavirus and was discharged. The detox place in Millbury couldn’t hold him, and neither could the halfway house in Chestnut Hill. One night Mikaela got an alert that Eitzmann was trying to use his credit card at a restaurant in Boston, and Larkee agreed to go looking for him. He found his ex-roommate on Boylston Street, having a steak dinner and an old-fashioned.He drove him to a facility in Worcester but feared it was pointless. “He’s going to have to do it on his own,” Larkee remembers thinking.After Eitzmann’s death, his friends began looking for something to blame. Some of his hedge fund friends decided he had suffered from mental illness. A few relatives pointed to a family history of addiction. His brother wondered whether decades of seeming so put together, of trying to be the hero of every story, had gradually ripped him apart.“It looked like he was so good at everything, that it all came easy,” Nate Eitzmann says. “But he must’ve put an intense amount of pressure on himself to succeed, and what he was feeling inside versus what we were seeing on the outside were probably two different things.”During a Zoom call with the Harvard roommates later, Nowinski said Eitzmann’s family had donated his brain to be analyzed for CTE. The response startled Nowinski. A few of the men issued unequivocal rejections that football could be responsible, a vigorous defense of a game that remains a precious ingredient to both identity and social matrix.“Just look at the evidence: We’ve been playing football for a hundred-plus years. What are we talking about here?” Larkee says. “He had a drinking problem for other reasons, some classic reasons. Some childhood stuff, high-pressure job, just general depression and personality issues and those type of things, like any normal person in their mid-40s would become an alcoholic and lose their family. Football player or not, that classic horrible, tragic story.”He continues a moment later.“For his loved ones, if it makes them feel better that that was his problem, that it wasn’t his fault, then that’s fine. I think it was Eitzmann’s fault.”For more than a decade now, this tension has coursed through the friend group as Nowinski insisted that CTE would eventually “get one of us.” In response, friends say, the former roommates established a separate text thread that doesn’t include Nowinski. That’s where they sometimes call him an “opportunist,” one ex-teammate says, and compare him to an ambulance-chasing attorney.“There’s still so much unknown,” says a different friend, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect his privacy and relationship with Nowinski. “Genetics and trauma, the effect of alcohol on the brain — it probably is a blend. That’s not a good enough story for him.”Some are willing to concede Nowinski’s contributions to accountability and football player safety, which one friend calls a “blessing.” The NFL reported a 30 percent reduction in concussions from 2015 to 2020, and the National Institutes of Health acknowledged for the first time last fall that repetitive traumatic brain injuries cause CTE.For the most part, though, they do what men their age do: They just don’t talk about it.“We are sort of beating around the bush of directly asking each other: Where do you fall on this?” Daigle says. “Chris sees CTE everywhere he looks because that’s his life. Scott sees a lack of evidence of CTE because he sees hundreds of football players a year.“If we were skewing, it would probably be to Chris’s side but with a bias toward saying we are not ideologues like Chris is on this. If he could ban football, he would.”Last September, Nowinski traveled past the Overtime Grill and Lounge, where, over beers that night, he had been one of the only friends to say he regrets playing football. He continued past the cemetery where Eitzmann’s remains are buried, alongside dense cornfields, eventually turning off the paved road.When families donate a loved one’s brain, the neuropathologist who studies it conducts a virtual meeting to explain the results. Nowinski doesn’t usually sit in, but this time he did.“I didn’t want to treat Chris as another research case,” he says.Nowinski and Mikaela sat on the family’s L-shaped sofa, and Ann McKee, director of the brain bank at Boston University, appeared on a laptop screen. Coen, who turned 15 last month, watched from the cushion between them, while the other children were at school. Coen is looking more like his father each day. He stands like him, shoulders back, and has the same jaw line and curiosity Eitzmann once brought from Nebraska to Cambridge.Coen witnessed many of his father’s worst moments, so Mikaela believed he had earned the right to know their source. McKee explained that she had found severe Stage 2 CTE, or a considerable amount of scar tissue in his brain. It could have been the cause of his alcohol abuse and impulsive behavior, along with Eitzmann’s deteriorating cognitive function. Eitzmann’s fried circuit board had become a wasteland.“There was nothing we could’ve done,” Mikaela says. At first this was a relief, she says. But as she processed McKee’s diagnosis, Mikaela realized she had actually lost her husband long ago. She believed that photo she had taken of their hands in 2019, just before dropping him off at the rehab place in Arizona, documented their true end.“Looking back now,” she says, “I never really had my real Chris back. He was just never himself ever again. I don’t think he was himself for a really long time.”After McKee signed off, Nowinski turned to Coen. The boy just stared. His father had been a great man, Nowinski said, and Eitzmann’s death had shattered him. They all had idolized him at Harvard, where everyone was a big shot but none as big as Chris Eitzmann. He had just been born into a town, a state, a country in love with a violent game, as addictive and culturally important as it is brutal.But what happened, Nowinski continued, wasn’t inevitable for Coen or his three younger siblings, and neither did it suggest either of them would —Mikaela interjected. She thanked Nowinski for coming, for bringing understanding and closure, for retelling a few stories from happier times. But it was getting late, and Coen needed to head out soon. It was fall in Middle America, and the young man had a football game that night.Nowinski and Nicole were coming back from a beach trip with friends recently, their kids asleep in the back seat. The topic of Chris Eitzmann came up. Nicole saw her husband’s face tighten, his skin turn red, that common sight of a middle-aged man using everything within him to avoid crying.“It just hits so close to home,” Nowinski said once the wave passed.He had felt many emotions after Eitzmann’s death: sadness, regret, guilt. He talked about none of them. It wasn’t just that Superman was dead; it was that helping people is Nowinski’s job, and even he couldn’t save him. If only Eitzmann or Mikaela had asked. Or if Nowinski had checked in more frequently. Or paid closer attention.“It broke Chris, and he’s still very, very, very broken,” Nicole says. “He kind of just handled it like, unfortunately, like you guys tend to do: just crawled into a hole.”By the time Nowinski emerged, so had a different emotion: fear. Two decades after his last wrestling match, Nowinski still takes prescription medication to ease headaches that can last all day. Though he discontinued his sleepwalking medication a few years ago, he still has vivid, disturbing dreams. Still, if he wakes in the night or feels foggy or forgets something, this is evidence, Nowinski says, that he has CTE. Be it soon or years from now, a fate similar to Eitzmann’s — and his family’s — is inevitable.“I’ve seen this pattern,” he says, “over and over and over again.”Mikaela admits she enabled Eitzmann, lied for him, helped him keep his secret. “I protected him for a really long time,” she says. It’s a regret she will live with forever.Nicole says Nowinski rarely drinks and has never been aggressive or menacing. She says she watches and “charts” her husband’s every move, comparing them with those from 15 years ago, when they first met in Boston.“I run my little science experiments all the time,” she says. “How has Chris changed? If he gets angry about something, is this just typical Chris behavior or is this a new type of anger? Or if he just forgets something, is this something he normally forgets? The headaches scare me, the sleep scares me, but that’s also been an issue since Day 1.”But what if Nowinski were to hide the severity of his symptoms, as Eitzmann did? If he knows how to address them, it stands to reason he also knows how to conceal them.“Chris is the love of my life and my best friend,” she says. “But I have to put my children first. His connections in the science field, they’re my connections as well. I’ve always been, in the back of my head, prepared for that, if it’s pretty or not. That’s my plan, just kind of go to his people —”She pauses, considering what it would mean to actually do what she’s describing.“— behind his back,” she continues, “and just ask for help.”For now, Nicole says, her objective is to listen and be supportive, even if Nowinski doesn’t want to talk. It’s to make him feel safe, she says, when he feels insecure or afraid and assure him they’re in this — whatever this is — together. On this late afternoon, Nowinski turned off the interstate as twilight approached. Nicole sat in the passenger seat of their SUV and leaned over. She looked at the sky and pointed out the orange and pink and purple streaks emerging.She gripped his hand as they drove, and Nowinski seemed calmer now as they listened to music and searched for new colors. Nicole squeezed tighter, a gentle reminder to her husband that she was there, would stay there, and that a day’s earlier moments don’t necessarily foretell how vibrant and lovely the sunset can sometimes be.",

      "title": "The return of the base thief",
      "text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — From his spot a few paces off the first base bag, Terrell Tatum had all the data points he needed. He checked the positioning of the opposing infielders, studied the pitcher’s movements, glanced at the pitch clock ticking toward zero, noted the catcher rising slightly out of his crouch in anticipation of a throw to second. And he knew, from the readout on the stopwatch his first base coach was holding, the pitcher’s delivery time: 1.3 seconds.The one thing Tatum ignored: the third base coach’s box. That’s because Tatum, a speedy Chicago White Sox prospect with the Class A Winston-Salem Dash, didn’t require a “steal” sign from his third base coach. This season, for the first time in his pro career, he has the “green light” — permission to steal whenever he believes he can make it safely. It’s a gift that came with a few words of advice from the White Sox official who informed Tatum during spring training:“You’d better take advantage,” the official said, according to Tatum, “and go.”Major League Baseball launched a slate of rule changes in the big leagues this season, all to hasten the pace of the game and create more action. The most visible and scrutinized are the limitations on infield shifts and the introduction of the pitch clock to keep pitchers and batters from stalling.But for prospects such as Tatum whose toolboxes include exceptional speed, the more significant changes were the ones designed in part to increase stolen base attempts: enlarged bases that reduce the distance between the edges of the bags by 4½ inches and especially the disengagement rule that limits a pitcher to two pickoff attempts or step-offs (which restart the pitch clock) per plate appearance.The rules were used across the minors in 2022, so baseball officials had some insight into their effects. But their introduction this season to the major league game — in which change is usually both slow to come and permanent — has altered the way organizations value players’ ability to steal a base or keep their opponent from stealing one.Almost instantly, Tatum, a 23-year-old outfielder, could sense that his career prospects had just gotten an immeasurable boost.“I knew it right away,” Tatum said of the moment in September when news broke of MLB’s rule changes starting in 2023. “This was going to be huge for me. I knew I was going to be able to steal a lot more bases.”Already this season, the results have been striking: Through May 9, MLB teams have attempted stolen bases at a rate of 0.90 per game, a 24 percent jump over last season — a year-over-year increase that roughly mirrors what the minor leagues experienced via the new rules in 2022 and which is the highest since 2012. The success rate of 78.6 percent this year, meanwhile, would rank as the highest in modern baseball history.Baseball hasn’t seen a 50-steal season since 2017 (Dee Strange-Gordon, Billy Hamilton), a 70-steal season since 2009 (Jacoby Ellsbury) or an 80-steal season since 1988 (Rickey Henderson, Vince Coleman). This year, Oakland’s Esteury Ruiz, with 17 steals in the Athletics’ first 37 games, was on a 74-steal pace through May 9, with a handful of other players close behind. And the first-place Pittsburgh Pirates, with 48 steals in the season’s first 37 games, were on pace for 210 this year, which would be the most by any team since the 1992 Milwaukee Brewers stole 256.Meanwhile, in the high Class A South Atlantic League, Tatum — with 13 stolen bases in his first 23 games of 2023 (or 0.57 per game) — is stealing at a clip that is more than 40 percent higher than his rate during the first two years of his pro career.During a recent game at Truist Stadium, the Dash’s 5,500-seat stadium in Winston-Salem, Tatum, on first base following a two-out single, waited patiently for his opportunity to take off for second. As he danced off the bag, he angled his body about 20 degrees toward second base, a tip given to him in college by fellow North Carolina State product Trea Turner, now a two-time stolen base champ. It affords him a split-second head-start on the pivot toward second.Because the opposing pitcher for the Hickory Crawdads, a Texas Rangers affiliate, had a relatively quick delivery — 1.3 seconds, per the stopwatch, from the start of his motion to the ball landing in the catcher’s mitt — Tatum needed to be careful.“If it’s above 1.3, I feel like that’s almost a free base,” he said later. “But 1.3 is pushing it. And anything lower, I have to make sure I have the perfect jump.”Throughout the next at-bat, Tatum varied his leads and faked a move toward second, forcing the pitcher to step off the mound — the first disengagement. Two pitches later, a pickoff attempt: unsuccessful. That was the second disengagement. Everybody on the field seemed to know what was coming next. By rule, a third disengagement by the pitcher would have to result in a successful pickoff or else Tatum would be awarded second base via a balk.“If the pitch clock is ticking down and you know [the pitcher] can’t throw over,” Tatum said, “you can basically just have the base. It’s a free stolen base every time.”Sure enough, Tatum took off on the next pitch, with a 2-2 count, and had the base easily stolen — except that the batter swung through the fastball for strike three, ending the inning. Instead of standing on second and turning his attention toward stealing third, Tatum brushed the dirt off his uniform and prepared to head out to center field.The stolen base had been dying a slow and steady death for decades, with two primary killers.The first was the growing influence of power pitching, with rising velocity and lab-designed breaking balls giving hitters little recourse except to match power with power and swing for the fences because teams were unlikely to score runs by stringing together singles against such nasty stuff. As home runs, walks and strikeouts rose in an increasingly all-or-nothing sport, almost everything else, from batting averages to sacrifice bunts to stolen bases, declined.The second factor was the rise of the analytics movement, with its guiding principle that the risk of losing one precious out was significantly higher — roughly three times, as measured in run-expectancy — than the reward of a successful steal of second. An 80 percent success rate on steals — or roughly the career rate of Henderson, the sport’s all-time stolen base king — became the accepted benchmark for whether it made sense to run. And because few players could steal at such a rate, few were allowed to try.“There’s a rule on this club. It’s okay if you get [the stolen base]. If you don’t, you got hell to pay,” then-Oakland Athletics third base coach Ron Washington explains to veteran Ray Durham near the end of “Moneyball,” Michael Lewis’s seminal 2003 book about the Billy Beane-era A’s and the rise of the analytics movement. “… Somebody on this team runs and gets his ass thrown out, and you got all kinds of gurus who tell you that you just took yourself out of the inning.”From the modern peak of 5,114 stolen base attempts in 1987, the numbers gradually dropped, bottoming out with just 2,924 in 2021 (not counting shortened seasons) — a 43 percent falloff. That same year, almost four decades after Henderson set the single-season record with 130 steals for the 1982 A’s, Turner led the National League with just 32.In announcing the 2023 rule changes in September, former Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs general manager Theo Epstein admitted “people like me” — data-obsessed executives looking to exploit every micro-efficiency in the name of winning — had largely driven the deterioration of the game’s aesthetics. “While it might have helped you win some more games, it didn’t necessarily change the game for the better for the fans in terms of the way the game is played on the field,” Epstein said.Taken as a whole, then, MLB’s new rules for 2023 are an attempt to inject back into the game some of what had been lost over the previous decades — with the stolen base receiving a singular focus. Baseball officials have said its focus groups and polling indicated fans wanted more action — and specifically stolen bases — back in the game.“Let’s give the fans more of what they like,” Epstein said, singling out “the running game.”It certainly gave a player such as Tatum more of what he likes. Before this year, he said, he felt stymied by the White Sox’s unwillingness to let him run, even complaining to a team official last summer. “Y’all aren’t letting me steal,” he said then. “That’s a big part of my game.”It was that same official who, during this year’s spring training, told Tatum the organization was giving him the green light for 2023 — and implored him to take advantage.“I feel I’m a hitter first,” Tatum said. “But if I don’t crush the ball — if I hit a dribbler up the third base line, I can turn that into a hit with my speed. And then steal second. So if I get on base with a walk or a bunt or a swinging bunt, I have a chance to turn that into a double. The new rules just allow me to play my complete game.”The math behind the stolen base has been more or less the same since Henderson’s days: A speedy base runner can go from reacting to a pitcher’s first move to touching second base in about 3.3 seconds. A pitcher who is quick to the plate can get the ball to his catcher in about 1.3 seconds. A catcher with a good arm and solid mechanics can get the ball from his mitt to the second base bag in about 2.0.The fact that 1.3 plus 2.0 equals 3.3 — a dead tie — is what makes the stolen base such a daring and beautiful act of athleticism. It was also one of the things that made baseball great. Put a runner on first who is a tick faster than 3.3 seconds and a catcher behind the plate who is sub-2.0 — Henderson against Iván “Pudge” Rodriguez, say — and you had one of the great individual matchups in the sport, the anticipation rising with every pitch.But in a sport such as baseball, with its many intricacies and nuances, even the smallest changes — such as tilting the base-stealing dynamic ever so slightly in the direction of the runner — are bound to have significant downstream effects, including assigning additional value to players with certain skill sets.It won’t be enough to turn a one-tool prospect into a future MLB star, especially when the baseline for adding extra value in a sport with more stolen bases across the board only will rise.But take a player with exceptional speed who is also a solid and improving defensive center fielder and a hitter with sneaky power and excellent strike-zone awareness who has gotten on base in both college and minor league ball at a clip of .400-plus — a player such as Tatum — and it can be a game changer. Maybe he gets to the big leagues sooner. Maybe he sticks longer. Maybe he has a chance to be a regular instead of a role player or a star instead of a platoon guy.“There’s going to be some change” in how teams value players, said Chris Getz, who played seven years in the majors and is now the White Sox’s assistant general manager for player development. “Perhaps the 26th man [on a roster] might look differently this year as in years past. It’s going to affect transactions as well. It might factor into who you’re going to add, a call-up or trade acquisition, knowing that speed could be a real weapon for the club.“When it comes to the future projection of players, I could see the run tool being weighted differently than it was two years ago. And I think this has the chance to elongate the careers of certain players.”But as with every small change to the offensive side of baseball, there is an opposite effect on the defensive side. When it comes to run prevention and specifically stopping the opponent from stealing bases, the task has grown substantially more difficult.Already, there is anecdotal evidence the new rules are affecting reliever usage late in games, with Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts acknowledging, “If you don’t have the ability to manage the running game, then you’re not a viable option to come into an inning with runners on base.”The game is already different. On April 29, the Dodgers won a 1-0 game over the St. Louis Cardinals with the only run scoring in the second inning on a single, a stolen base and another single — the type of small-ball rally that had nearly gone extinct by the end of 2022.“It’s stuff we’re thinking about and talking about all the time,” said Josh Byrnes, the Dodgers’ senior vice president of baseball operations. “I remember this spring, [pitching coach] Mark Prior told our pitchers, ‘Okay, fellas, everyone needs to be 1.3 [seconds] or faster to the plate now.’ You haven’t had to spend as much energy on that in the past, but now you do. It’s in your face. If you’re not on point, they’re going to run wild on you.”Byrnes predicted such conversations would filter down to the draft, perhaps altering the way teams value certain tools in making their picks.“These are topics we haven’t had to discuss in a long time,” he said. “Trying to steal bases and defend the stolen base are bigger parts of the game now, and that affects player-personnel decisions. Even in the draft, guys who are above-average runners are going to be more prominent. Catchers with the ability to throw out runners are going to be more prominent. There are players who all of a sudden are better major league prospects in today’s atmosphere.”One of those prospects, it stands to reason, is Tatum. Drafted by the White Sox in the 16th round in 2021, he has never been considered a phenom. In MLB.com’s recent list of the White Sox’s top prospects, he ranked just 25th. Baseball America rated him 24th. FanGraphs’ list was 26-deep and did not include Tatum.Tatum said he had been given a season-long green light only once before in his career: as a junior at N.C. State in 2020. That year, in a season shortened by the pandemic, he went 7 for 7 in stolen base attempts.He still has fewer than 100 games and 400 plate appearances as a professional, largely the result of a positive test for an amphetamine last year that resulted in a 50-game suspension, plus an ankle injury that cut short his stint in the Arizona Fall League.The sudden boost to his career, in the form of a rule change that works in his favor, came at the perfect time.“For me, Tatum is a guy who can run on 1.3,” said White Sox field coordinator Doug Sisson, speaking of an opposing pitcher’s time to home plate. Part of Sisson’s job is working with the White Sox’s minor leaguers on the intricacies of base running. “If you face teams that are really good at shutting down the running game, teams where every pitcher is 1.2, you may not see us run for a few games. You can’t outrun the ball, and you can’t outrun the stopwatch.”One recent afternoon at Truist Stadium, Sisson worked with Tatum and the other Dash position players on ancillary (or secondary) leads — the initial movements toward second base that a runner takes just as the pitcher commits to delivering the pitch.“The advantage of getting a good ancillary lead is to try to get two disengagements early in the at-bat,” Sisson said. “Because then you’re off to the races.”It is one more subtle way in which the game has tilted in favor of the base runner. Because pickoff throws are now a finite quantity thanks to the disengagement rule, there is now an incentive for a base runner to rattle the pitcher in hopes of drawing a throw over. It happens to be something for which Tatum has shown some aptitude.“This is a guy who has major league tools,” Sisson said. “He’s going to be a good major league player.”",

      "title": "His mom got him a $3 slingshot. He used it to stop a kidnapper, police say.",
      "text": "Owen Burns assumed his little sister was goofing off with her friends in the backyard when he heard her screaming, something he found annoying. But when the 13-year-old looked out his bedroom window moments later, he saw a stranger holding a hand over his 8-year-old sister’s mouth as he tried to drag her into the nearby woods.Owen turned to his bed and grabbed his slingshot and any ad hoc ammunition he could find: a marble and a rock, as it turned out. From his bedroom, he loaded the marble first, pulled back the slingshot’s yellow, plastic tubing, aimed out his open window at the stranger some 200 feet away and let go.The shot hit him — right between the eyes. Then Owen loaded the rock and fired again — another hit, this time to the chest.“He was swearing. He was cussing,” Owen told The Washington Post.It was the start of a bizarre encounter on May 10 outside Owen’s house in Alpena Township, Mich., where attempted kidnappings “don’t really happen,” according to Maggie Burns, the children’s mother. By day’s end, Owen’s sister would be safe, if traumatized, Owen would be hailed a hero with impressive aim and a 17-year-old local would be behind bars, accused of trying to abduct an 8-year-old from her backyard.Michigan State Police did not identify the 17-year-old in its news release but said he’s being charged as an adult. Law enforcement praised Owen for neutralizing a scary situation that could have turned into a tragedy.“He really is the one that ... I believe saved his sister’s either life or from something seriously bad happening to her,” Lt. John Grimshaw said at a news conference, calling Owen’s actions “extraordinary.”“He should be commended for it,” he added.Owen’s slingshot is nothing fancy. His mother bought it for him on clearance for $3 a couple years ago, he told The Post. Since then, he’s gone out in the backyard from time to time to do some target practice using old orange juice cans.He wasn’t using it on the afternoon of May 10, at least not at first. Instead, he was just settling in to “Call of Duty: Black Ops II” on his PlayStation 3 after getting home from school. His sister was hunting for mushrooms in the backyard, which backs up into some woods. They were alone, having arrived home before their parents, which was unusual.That’s when the 17-year-old emerged from the woods and tried to snatch Owen’s 8-year-old sister, who screamed and struggled, state police said in a news release. When Owen first saw what was happening, he said, a thought flashed through his mind: If this stranger kidnapped his sister, he might turn her into a sex slave or kill her.As Grimshaw later recounted, the suspect “came from behind her, grabbed her like you see in the movies — hand over the mouth, arm around the waist — and was attempting to pull her into the woods.”That’s when Owen reached for the slingshot and hit him twice. Having freed herself, his sister came inside, crying, telling her brother she had almost been killed. Owen roared out of the house, yelling and cursing while the guy started to take off. As the stranger kept running, Owen grabbed a baseball and hurled it at him, missing just over his shoulder. Then, Owen returned to his trusty slingshot, stretching the sling back as he prepared to fire a third shot. But the plastic band broke, causing Owen to smack himself in the face with his hand.The stranger got away — but not with his sister.The siblings called their mother, who had stopped to help a family member on the way home from work. Her children were hysterical and incoherent, but she could make out the word “kidnapped.” Racing home, she called the police.“I was in shock for a few days,” Maggie said.Troopers said they found the 17-year-old suspect hiding at a nearby gas station. He was charged with attempted kidnapping, attempted felony assault, and misdemeanor assault and battery in Alpena County District Court.“He had obvious signs of an injury consistent with those that would have been sustained from the slingshot strikes to his head and chest,” police said in a news release.Maggie said that, at first, she didn’t believe her son had sniped a stranger from some 200 feet away. She thought he was talking big. Then, police informed her of the 17-year-old’s telltale injuries. They said that, as investigators interviewed the suspect, the marble-induced goose egg on his head kept growing.“You said I always lie!” Owen told his mother.“I just couldn’t believe it,” she responded. “It just didn’t sound real, until there was proof. It sounds like something you would see in the movies.”“Mom,” Owen said, “stuff in the movies can and do happen in real life.”",

      "title": "Perspective | Nikola Jokic is now, Victor Wembanyama is next and the NBA is worldwide",
      "text": "The night began with San Antonio Spurs Chairman Peter Holt screaming in delight over winning the lottery for French phenom Victor Wembanyama and ended with Serbian superstar Nikola Jokic taking shots that seemed to exit the atmosphere before splashing down into the net. It was a banner, global doubleheader for the NBA, not merely an indicator of the sport’s growth worldwide but a show of utter dominance.Although a wealth of American talent sustains the NBA, the most compelling and coveted young players in the game now were introduced to basketball abroad. If a streak of five straight foreign-born NBA MVPs wasn’t persuasive enough, and if four international stars making the all-NBA first team this season didn’t do the trick, then how about seeing a middle-aged man celebrating the right to draft Wembanyama by acting like he just scored Taylor Swift tickets?“I … I … I might faint,” Holt said on ESPN on Tuesday night.Others would rather roll their eyes. The envy isn’t limited to San Antonio, the forever home of David Robinson and Tim Duncan, landing the No. 1 pick during another draft blessed with a supreme big man prospect. There’s also a faction, which plenty of NBA players will lead on the sly, destined to tire quickly of the Victor hype and relegate him to the same reputation purgatory that Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have experienced. In general, NBA discourse is the Hater’s Ball of sports. Yet for as half-witted and spiteful as the public can be, the competitors are also as catty as they come. The adoration international players receive is a particular sore spot.On one hand, it’s understandable because the league’s players, who are predominantly African American, have long endured prejudicial criticism. Sometimes, the appreciation of “refreshing” global talent can sound like veiled anti-Black sentiments. Still, game is supposed to recognize game. But as fresh and groundbreaking talent emerges around the world, a zero-sum mentality creates a battle for influence.Some of the hesitance to anoint beloved players prematurely is customary pro sports behavior. But the whispers of ridicule about some international stars gets ridiculous at times. Behind the obligatory compliments, Antetokounmpo was dismissed by his peers before he dominated the 2021 NBA Finals and led the Milwaukee Bucks to a championship. Even now, as he makes his corny dad jokes and pontificates about the absence of failure, he doesn’t command the respect in every locker room of a two-time MVP who has been the league’s most dominant player over the past five seasons.Jokic, another two-time MVP, has encountered disrespect as he continues to rise in stature. At the height of it, Kendrick Perkins, a former player turned ESPN analyst, accused him of padding stats. Perkins was trying to explain away Joker’s all-around effectiveness to boost the MVP candidacy of Joel Embiid, the eventual winner. Jokic laughed it off. But to his peers, Jokic will be more darling than game changer until his retro-modern game results in more than carrying the Denver Nuggets through hardship.French center Rudy Gobert, who has won three defensive player of the year awards, is often challenged and derided as soft. When players griped on social media about the all-NBA voting, one unstated source of their frustration was clear: Canadian guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who averaged 31.4 points this season.There’s an incredulous vibe right now. The celebration of enhanced inclusivity always comes with some fear of replacement. The American basketball player is still the standard. But the most recognizable faces of the NBA game are certain to look different. If you’re looking for an elite combination of size and skill, the greatest of those prodigies are sprouting elsewhere. From Slovenian guard Luka Doncic functioning as a supersized floor general to Jokic controlling the game as a 280-pound point center, the world isn’t catching up. The world has arrived, complete with a Greek Freak and a Cameroonian center who plays like a 21st-century Hakeem Olajuwon.Over the past three decades, foreign-born players have diversified the game, expanded our basketball palate — and saved the big man from extinction. Quality bigs, though rare now, didn’t disappear. They just wandered overseas and redefined the position.And here comes Wembanyama, a 7-foot-4 evolutionary athlete who plays defense like a classic center, dribbles and shoots as well as players a foot shorter and possesses a charisma that could help the NBA captivate the world in new ways.A prospect hasn’t carried so much justified hype since LeBron James was drafted out of high school in 2003. Some consider Wembanyama the greatest phenom in basketball history, which is unquantifiable and silly. But for those who have lived through a lot of next big things, it doesn’t matter where Wembanyama ranks among them. What’s important is that he looks to be one of them.Spurs win NBA draft lottery and right to select Victor WembanyamaAnd what’s remarkable is that we have been able to see him coming, all the way from Paris, the big basketball world within reach of a teenager with an 8-foot wingspan. As the NBA has grown as a global brand, no player has come to America with so much name recognition and praise. If he reaches his potential, Wembanyama will reconceive a sport eager for more big men who can play the fluid, positionless style that now dominates the game.First, he must prove himself. The players can’t wait to test him. If he stays healthy, Wembanyama has reason to be encouraged his game will translate. He enters the NBA in the same summer that international legends Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker will be enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame. His future coach, Gregg Popovich, is also in the class of 2023.And as the NBA playoffs near a conclusion, ol’ stat-padding Jokic is on top of his game. In the Nuggets’ Game 1 victory over the Los Angeles in the Western Conference finals, Jokic scored 34 points, grabbed 21 rebounds and dished 14 assists. He owned a game in which Anthony Davis finished with 40 points and James fell one assist shy of his own triple-double.If the Nuggets simply needed Jokic to score, his points alone would have been impressive. If they simply needed him to rebound, his Dennis Rodman-like board work would have warranted raves. If they simply needed a table-setting playmaker, his dimes would have been worthy of headlines. But he did it all at once, directing an offense that shot 55 percent and made 15 three-pointers and owning the paint as the Nuggets outrebounded the Lakers by 17.To add icing, Jokic hit a casual 28-foot stepback jumper with Davis all over him, the highlight of a night in which he destroyed one of the league’s most potent defensive players.JOKIC 3️⃣ OVER AD TO END THE THIRD‼️ pic.twitter.com/yUEgHUerdzAfter the shot fell through, Davis looked over his shoulder at Jokic and grinned. With both palms up, Jokic shrugged.“There’s nothing else I could have done,” said Davis, who watched Jokic make 10 of 13 shots when he was guarding the former MVP.There was no NBA culture war to fight on this night. Jokic was a force, not embellished great hope. And the excitement over Wembanyama’s arrival is already causing lightheadedness. The game keeps growing, in every direction.",

      "title": "Perspective | Ja Morant’s friends aren’t the problem. His judgment is.",
      "text": "Ja Morant made yet another boneheaded decision, flashed a gun (again) and got slapped with a most laughable suspension by his team. Yet somehow, it was all his friend’s fault.The friend, Davonte Pack, went live Saturday on Instagram so he and a car full of grown men could stream their rap-a-long to the amusement of his followers. Morant was at the wheel, while the friend held up his phone from the passenger seat. Aside from the childish behavior they were exhibiting and the vulgar lyrics they were butchering, it appeared to be a light moment had by a couple of buddies. But Morant, the dynamic star of the Memphis Grizzlies, just had to show off his gun. Naturally, the blame fell on the one without the shoe and soft drink endorsements.Because in a society that conflates money with merit, the multimillionaire in love with gunplay is allowed second, third and eighth chances. Thanks to a public relations machine that builds a sympathetic narrative — and a gullible audience willing to soak it up — he can be portrayed as a protagonist awaiting redemption. The people he chooses to occupy his world are cast as the toadies who should take the fall.The friends are not afforded the same grace for being young and immature and needing to learn. They are viewed as the vices. The bad actors and evil influences who snake their way into the lives of the rich and admired. Even if the truth is they’ve been around before the money and fame, they are mislabeled as nefarious figures simply hanging on for a sliver of their friend’s spotlight.Grizzlies suspend Ja Morant after he appears to show gun in new videoThis is Morant’s second known incident involving a gun in the past three months; in March, he streamed himself on Instagram holding up a small gun while in a Denver nightclub. It follows a string of violent and troubling behavior of which he and others have been accused: punching a teenager at his home, threatening a Finish Line employee, acting like heavies inside a high school because someone called his sister a name. On Sunday, as the latest video spread on social media, Morant, 23, deservedly absorbed criticism. He also still managed to find those who watched the short clip and came away thinking, how could he? Not Morant. How could Pack do his friend that way?Former player Kwame Brown chastised Pack for knowing Morant had a gun in the car and recording anyway, while Los Angeles Lakers guard D’Angelo Russell offered advice on Twitter: “If you can’t change the people around you, change the people around you.” Others on the same platform also pinned this blunder on the friend.The friend should have never turned his phone toward Morant. But if that’s true, then maybe he should have never hit record. Or never even possessed a smartphone in the first place. When traveling with his very rich, very well-known, very tempestuous bestie, Pack should keep only a carrier pigeon to communicate with the outside world. That way, the next time Morant momentarily goes brain-dead, Pack can wrestle the firearm away, while the pigeon dispatches to the team of lawyers, agents and propagandists who can’t even wake up on Mother’s Day without learning their client is trending on Twitter.Pack has his own history in gangsta cosplay: He walked onto the court during a game against the Indiana Pacers in February and verbally confronted players. For that, he was banned from attending Grizzlies home games last season. In this duo, Pack isn’t exactly the levelheaded one. He, like Morant, is an intemperate young man obsessed with throwing away his future. It’s just that Morant can jump higher.Morant receives understanding and forgiveness, though he continues to show himself as audacious and defiant. Either he hasn’t learned from his previous eight-game suspension or he just doesn’t care about consequences. He is the star. Not only in the video but also in his life, where clearly he has rejected wise counsel for the company of fools. A carload of them, while Morant takes the captain’s seat.So, God help Ja Morant’s friend, the sidekick stuck riding shotgun. At least he tried.In Memphis, Ja Morant’s summer of trouble went unchecked by authoritiesPack tried to stop the backlash that would surely follow from Morant flashing a gun. He tried to shield the fact that this multimillionaire is so uncomfortable driving the streets on a sunny weekend day that he feels compelled to carry heat.Soon after Pack spiced up this carpool karaoke by making a gun gesture, the camera moved over to Morant, who was now dancing with an actual gun in his hand. Pack immediately dropped the phone. He tried to protect Morant and his brand. He was the one who seemed to have a modicum of common sense. Even though no one in that car appears to have learned not to play with guns, including his wealthy best friend, at least Pack realized he shouldn’t show it to the world.But Morant keeps showing us who he is. Not in the apologetic written statements, nor while being served up softballs by a non-journalist at ESPN so he can meekly say “the gun wasn’t mine.” Instead, Morant reveals himself through his actions.Surely in the coming days or weeks, we can expect to read and hear more contrition from Morant. More about the anxiety he suffers from or the therapy he’ll undergo while serving this offseason suspension, which was issued too late by the Grizzlies in an attempt to contain the problem child they helped create. Rather than rushing to absolve Morant and assigning culpability to his lesser-known friends, it’s time to believe Morant has the capacity to make terrible decisions all by himself. He doesn’t need anyone to lead him astray. And possibly, it is Pack who needs a better friend.Just like Morant, Pack is a young man too enraptured with searching for all the smoke. Except he’s viewed as the malevolent force in Morant’s master plan. The problem with that storyline is the video evidence. On Saturday, two friends were in a car. They were rapping and having a good time. Then, one pulled out a gun. Now, it’s hard to distinguish the parasite from the host.",

      "title": "Perspective | The Preakness is coming, and all of horse racing holds its breath",
      "text": "BALTIMORE — It was brisk, almost bracing, on the Thursday morning before the Preakness Stakes when Mage came off the final turn, an easy gallop for a pre-9 a.m. workout at Pimlico Race Course. The dirt flew behind him. The front stretch laid out ahead. Whether he had a care in the world, he didn’t say. Certainly didn’t look like it. Beautiful, almost breathtaking animals, these thoroughbreds.Mage won the Kentucky Derby, and when the Preakness goes off Saturday evening, he will be the heavy favorite in the second leg of the Triple Crown. But after a tragic meet at Churchill Downs that again shook a creaky sport to its core — seven dead horses over 10 days, with little connective tissue as to how or why — the more important news Saturday will be less about who won the race than whether the eight animals asked to run 1 3/16th miles all make it back to the barn in good health. A sport, for now, holds its breath.“He behaved perfectly,” said Gustavo Delgado Jr., the Venezuelan who works closely with his father, Mage’s head trainer, after the workout. “Did everything right. Then when he came back, he looked more professional today than yesterday. And on his way back to the barn he was calm and collected.”That’s not really this sport at this moment, calm and collected. The people who own these horses and care for these horses and love these horses say time and again how well they’re cared for, and in a blanket sense, that’s true.“They’re like their kids,” said Chase Chamberlin, half of a partnership that owns a quarter of Mage. “They really are.”Dark week at Churchill Downs sparks questions about horse racing’s futureBut would parents ask their children to participate in an activity that results in 1.25 deaths per 1,000 starts? That’s the number the Jockey Club, a trade organization, cites as the equine fatality rate for racehorses in 2022 — which is an improvement, the lowest since the organization started keeping track in 2009.There is so much at work here, and it’s so easy for vultures to swirl when horses fall in such numbers — as they did at Santa Anita in 2019, when the California track lost 30 horses in the winter and spring and then another in the high-profile Breeders’ Cup Classic that November. But it’s hard to marry the notion that those who know the sport from the inside are open to — and in fact push for — changes to how horses are medicated and evaluated for competition, when some of those same people have fought against such standards. Horse racing and the general public have a trust problem, and it’s well-earned.Consider this: When Congress brought forth a bill known as the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act in 2020 — after the spate of deaths at Santa Anita — associations and state officials in Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia sued to strike the measure down. A path to progress?The objections were mostly around logistics — who would have power to oversee what. The optics stunk. The result is that new anti-doping and medicine control standards have been delayed by more than a year. Legal haggling has them going into effect … Monday, two days after the Preakness. There is, too, this backdrop: Two of the sport’s most decorated trainers, Hall of Famers Todd Pletcher and Bob Baffert, have been suspended by racing authorities in New York and Kentucky, respectively, for positive drug tests in their horses.This is the best the sport has to offer, trailed by suspicion and pleas for understanding?“Our horse’s care comes first,” Chamberlin said Thursday, and he no doubt means it.“One breakdown is too many,” he said. “It is a very rare occurrence. I think there’s an element of, everybody needs to keep their side of the street clean. That’s one way to start.”But what about the owner in the next stall? If the general public looks askance at statements like that — knowing horses have been drugged, knowing horses have died, and knowing some within the sport have pushed back on change — who can blame them?“We have this HISA organization that is trying to get off the ground, and our own horsemen are fighting it,” said longtime Maryland-based trainer Graham Motion, who won the 2011 Kentucky Derby with Animal Kingdom. “That is such a shame. We have got to evolve with the times, and we need national organization. They have to give this a chance.”Odds, post positions and analysis for the 2023 Preakness StakesThere is, for now, no known link among the deaths that led up to the Kentucky Derby. But what is undeniable is that, even in good times, these horses are massive, 1,000-pound animals riding at great speeds with human beings on their backs. They are, at the same time, incredibly fragile and incapable of describing their aches and pains.“An athlete comes off at halftime of the Super Bowl and says, ‘My ankle is killing me,’ and you can handle that as you want,” Motion said Thursday by phone. “He’s got a choice whether you treat the ankle, or he gets pulled out of the game. We have the responsibility of looking after the horses, and they can’t tell us what hurts. We have to figure that out.”And when a horse can’t speak for itself, a vet must make the call. That’s what happened to Derby favorite Forte, trained by Pletcher, who was scratched in the hours before the race because state racing commission veterinarian Nick Smith thought the horse was affected by a bruised foot.“We’ve all been in that situation,” Motion said. “It’s just magnified 100-fold when it’s the Kentucky Derby. I’m sure that it’s something that any other day of the week, it would have been acceptable. But with the pressure that’s on our sport on that day, and the eyes of the world are watching, you have to sympathize with the veterinarians who just have to be incredibly cautious.”So here comes the Preakness, in which Mage is the only Derby horse who will run just two short weeks later. That’s the first time in 54 years that just one horse who ran the Derby will run here. That’s caution — understandably.“I don’t think there’s any trainer who’ll tell you he’s 100 percent sure that he’s not going to regret that kind of thing,” Delgado Jr. said. “ … But all the signs … that we wanted to see in order to take this chance are there.”Go to any betting window at Pimlico, and that’s what you’re taking: A chance. What the sport of horse racing says it doesn’t want to do is to take chances with its athletes — equine and human — or its future. Hold your breath for the racing to be over, and for long-awaited change to come.",

      "title": "Perspective | After a rocky Game 1 loss, Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla could use a timeout",
      "text": "BOSTON — The expectations for a Boston Celtics title run are evident around TD Garden. The most visible reminder has to be the big, bold billboard plastered outside the building that reads: “Unfinished Business.” The message evokes the memory of the Celtics falling two wins short of a championship a year ago. Adding even more emphasis: Two of the letters within the slogan are designed to look like a “1″ and an “8.”There are also obvious reminders that the Celtics are chasing the franchise’s 18th championship banner with a rookie coach. It comes up when Joe Mazzulla gets face time with a national audience, as he did Wednesday when TNT announcer Kevin Harlan served up the in-game coaching interview with the introduction: “The youngest head coach in the NBA.” Mostly, however, the indicators of Mazzulla’s inexperience emerge every time Boston takes a step back in its title pursuit, as it did by dropping Wednesday’s opening game of the Eastern Conference finals to the eighth-seeded Miami Heat.Mazzulla, 34, inherited a championship-ready team but not the accompanying respect. His decisions get dissected and, worse, second-guessed. Even by some of the paying customers, who plead from their seats for him to call a timeout — a favorite gripe that hangs over Mazzulla and one he seems done talking about. But after the Celtics lost, 123-116, on Wednesday night, largely because of a third-quarter collapse in which they surrendered 46 points, Mazzulla couldn’t escape his least favorite topic. After the game, reporters asked variations of the same question. Pretty much: Hey rookie, why didn’t you do anything to break up the Heat’s 21-12 run until nearly the midway point of the quarter?“Get better shots, don’t turn it over, and don’t foul, don’t give up offensive rebounds and don’t give up threes,” Mazzulla said, choosing to answer literally a question about what could have been done to stop the run.And when asked how he balances letting the game play out vs. calling a timeout, Mazzulla, clearly annoyed, responded tersely while dodging the query.“I called two in the first quarter,” Mazzulla chirped.For the fourth time this postseason, the second-seeded Celtics lost at home. Mazzulla didn’t turn the ball over multiple times in the final quarter as all-NBA player Jayson Tatum did. And though he didn’t allow the Heat to shoot 51.6 percent from the arc (16 for 31), he will shoulder the majority of criticism for the Game 1 setback. Such is the life of a rookie coach who was given one of the best teams in the NBA — and the pressure of not messing it all up.We all know the story by now. Mazzulla shouldn’t even be in this position. Last year when Ime Udoka, himself a rookie coach at the time, formed the Celtics into a championship-caliber team, Mazzulla was an assistant stationed behind the bench. In October, however, the team suspended Udoka for having an improper relationship with a team employee and promoted the little-known coach from Rhode Island. The regular season went smoothly — the Celtics won 57 games, and Mazzulla finished third in voting for the league’s coach of the year honor.The intense young coach practices jujitsu, plays prison-style ball with his coaching staff and allegedly watches “The Town” four times a week — charming stories, though it was all the wins that helped build Mazzulla’s credibility. Those wins also made people forget — or not care — that Mazzulla prefers to give his veteran team the freedom to figure things out. The Celtics have two of the top 15 players in the league in Tatum and Jaylen Brown; Marcus Smart, last season’s defensive player of the year; and Malcolm Brogdon, this season’s sixth man of the year. Also: Robert Williams III, the lob threat and paint protector, and the respected O.G. of the bunch, Al Horford. The team is stacked, and Mazzulla has been smart enough to stay out the way, declining to call timeouts when his players hit rough patches. Even when he does stop the action, Mazzulla doesn’t appear to dominate a huddle. At times Wednesday, despite being allotted 3 minutes 30 seconds in a timeout, Mazzulla would keep it moving, spending as little as 15 seconds actually addressing players on the sideline.However, even that brief amount of communication would have been greeted with applause had Mazzulla called for time as Boston’s nine-point halftime lead dwindled away. He instead chose to wait until the 6:28 mark. The lead vanished while Miami seized control of the third quarter and ultimately the game. During that timeout, Mazzulla tossed his clipboard and walked away from the huddle.“Joe is real big on a lot of times not bailing us out on stuff when we’re playing like s---. So we’ve got to look ourselves in the mirror. Joe can call a timeout, and then what, we come out and do the same thing? It’s on us,” Smart said. “Joe and his coaching staff, they put in a lot of work to come up with a game plan and put us in the right spots to succeed, but they’re not out there playing. We’ve got to come together, and we’ve got to start helping each other out on both ends.”After the game, Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra could sit in peace. He wasn’t asked about his timeout usage. He didn’t face any pointed questions from the media about lulls in his team’s performance. No second guessing whatsoever.This tranquility, of course, had everything to do with his team winning on the road. His postgame media session was so easy, so full of respect, that at one point a reporter even attempted to ask Spoelstra about the potential of becoming only the second No. 8 seed to make the NBA Finals — though the Heat still has the arduous task of winning three more times for that scenario to play out.Across the back corridors of the arena, where the coach of the home team sat and stewed, there were no inquiries about the upcoming Finals. Mazzulla, whose curt and defensive responses to reporters’ questions have not helped his cause, faced another interrogation about his choices and his coaching style. Following that media session, Mazzulla walked out, grabbed his backpack, a to-go box of fruit and walked down the hallway with his wife. For a few minutes, at least, the only questions he confronted were inside his own head.",

      "title": "Analysis | Durability was Max Scherzer’s superpower. Not so much these days.",
      "text": "Max Scherzer never used to be the kind of ace people worried about.Here, at Nationals Park, that was Stephen Strasburg, the guy who might find himself aching at any moment, the one for whom trainers stood ready on the top step. Scherzer played 6½ years in Washington. Only once did he go on the injured list. If Strasburg was hurt, well, at least the Nationals had Scherzer.In the New York Mets’ dugout, the ace they worried about was Jacob DeGrom. He was the one they worried would throw a pitch, shake his arm and walk off into a few months of oblivion. Before the 2022 season, the Mets signed Scherzer to be the sure thing, the steady ace they struggled to develop for the last half-decade as Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard and others watched their careers devolve into fragility, too. Even at his age, Scherzer was a known commodity. The Mets knew Scherzer would take the ball.But by the time Scherzer took the mound at Nationals Park on Sunday, no one — including Scherzer himself — knew exactly what the 38-year-old with the 5.56 ERA had to give. The answer, for one day, was that he had enough.“Physically good enough that I will be able to avoid the IL and now get back in the routine and get going,” Scherzer said. “That’s the most important thing, to be able to avoid the IL, be out there, be healthy and throw the ball well.”Scherzer threw five innings of one-run ball against a Nationals lineup that has MLB’s 26th-highest OPS but has proved it is not a pushover. His fastball touched 96 a few times — not as often as it used to but as often as he needed. In the second game of what was basically a doubleheader, the Mets pulled him after just 83 pitches. He had not thrown his usual 100 pitches or so in a while. They had to be careful. Besides, he said, he was not at full cardio strength.“Actually, today, this was probably the most winded I’ve ever been in a start,” said Scherzer, who has made 427 of them in his career. “I was huffing and puffing. I wasn’t tired. I was just out of breath because the last six days I haven’t done a thing. I’ve been sitting in a neck brace. I feel like now I can get through this start, now I can get back in my routine, get my running in. That way I’m physically fit and can get out there and actually pitch better.”In the past, Scherzer’s seeming certainty that he is through the worst of things would be plenty of evidence the future Hall of Famer would be just fine. He always seemed to know exactly what was wrong and how long it would take to fix it; he seemed to know exactly when he was out of harm’s way or still at risk. These days require more skepticism. Scherzer has flashed normality at times during his Mets tenure, only to see something disrupt his ability to establish it consistently.“Max is probably the highlight [today], Max feeling good physically and getting through it,” Mets Manager Buck Showalter said. “He hasn’t been able to do a lot of cardiovascular work with this, and you could tell he was a little winded there toward the end. But I would have signed in blood for him to get through five innings and get his pitch count up.”People are counting on Dave Martinez. He knows it.Scherzer had not pitched since May 3 because of back soreness, then a neck spasm, and that day he gave up six runs in 3⅓ innings to the Detroit Tigers. Before that, he had not pitched since April 19 because he was serving a 10-game suspension for a sticky pitching hand. From 2015 through 2021, no one threw more innings than Scherzer, and it wasn’t close. This year, as of Mother’s Day, Scherzer has not thrown enough innings to qualify for league leads.He dropped his appeal of that suspension, which seemed out of character for a player who once offered to disrobe on the field when it was suggested he might be hiding sticky stuff on his belt. He said publicly he knew any appeal would be heard by Major League Baseball, so even if he repeated his explanation about using only legal substances, he probably wouldn’t win. What went unsaid was that serving a suspension gave Scherzer time to figure out how to deal with a balky back before it sent him to the injured list.Ultimately, he did avoid the injured list. But his return was delayed. So was his next start because Scherzer’s neck seized up last week, just like it did before Game 5 of the 2019 World Series, like it did every now and then during his Nationals tenure. In those days, he would wait a day or two and return, no worse for the wear.Yet as recently as Friday, Showalter was wondering whether Scherzer’s spasming neck would withstand a bullpen session. They have legitimate reason to wonder about Scherzer, about his oblique and his back and his neck, about all the things that have forced him to the injured list more times in the year and a half of his Mets career (three) than in his entire career beforehand. His velocity was down in his last start against the Tigers. He was getting fewer swings and misses this year than in any since 2014. His velocity looked better Sunday. The Nationals whiffed on 39 percent of the pitches at which they swung.“I don’t think he had to push to get to [his velocity]. You could see him in his other outings, he’d go get it some when he had to. But you could tell it was max effort to get there,” Showalter said. “It was pretty easy for him to get to today. The ball was coming out of his hand; you could tell from the dugout, it was coming out of his hand. You look for late life, and he had that late life he has when he’s effective.”So for today — and perhaps for five days from now, too — everything is fine. But no one used to even wonder. Scherzer would say the slew of injuries he has experienced with the Mets is mere coincidence, not the sign of an inevitable physical breakdown. Presented with the idea time might be catching up with him, Scherzer rejected it outright.“It’s baseball. Do you realize how many little things I’ve dealt with?” Scherzer asked, defiant, at his locker a few weeks ago. “Always. I’ve gone a whole year with 33 starts and only had three starts where I felt good. The other 30 I dealt with something. I once had a broken finger. I was miserable for a year and didn’t miss a start.”Scherzer argued the same thing one afternoon in spring training. He explained, injury by injury, moment by moment, how everything that has gone wrong since he got to the Mets was the result of something identifiable — not something anyone could chalk up to age. He knew exactly when he pushed too hard. He says he knows exactly what he needs to do to manage the back and neck long term. The one thing Scherzer doesn’t articulate — the one thing time might best explain — is why those aches and pains never used to stop him.Maybe he is back for good, fixed and whole, durable again. But the uncomfortable fact for Scherzer and the underachieving Mets is that these days, it is reasonable to wonder.",

      "title": "Lebanon deporting refugees to Syria to face an uncertain fate       ",
      "text": "BEIRUT — Abu Hussein’s stomach churned with worry when the Lebanese army knocked on his door at 5 a.m. last month. He chose to believe the soldiers when they said they were picking him up to fix his paperwork. He chose to believe them when they said they were there on behalf of the United Nations.But when he saw the familiar road to Syria, his country of origin, he felt the fear in his stomach rise to the back of his throat.“I asked an officer, ‘Excuse me, but where are we going? Where are you taking us?’ He told me, ‘We got the order to deport you. We’re handing you over to the Syrian army.’”The 26-year-old, now in hiding in Syria, shared his story with The Washington Post on the condition that he be identified by his nickname and that his location not be disclosed. Abu Hussein estimates he was one of about 250 Syrians deported that day by Lebanese authorities, who in recent weeks have begun turning over refugees to their Syrian counterparts.Once across the border, some of the men have disappeared into Syrian custody — detained by authorities for past political activity or evasion of army conscription, according to human rights groups, who are calling for a halt to what they say are unlawful deportations. Amnesty International has so far documented at least four men who were detained upon deportation.Arab embrace of Assad underscores divergence with U.S. over SyriaThe timing of the returns coincides with a move by Arab states to normalize relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. After a 12-year suspension, Syria was welcomed back into the Arab League this month, and on Friday Assad attended a regional summit in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where the return of refugees was high on the agenda.Abu Hussein is wanted by the Syrian government for working in media as protests engulfed the country in 2011 and quickly devolved into a brutal civil war. Assad refused to comply with popular demands to resign, cracking down on his people with bombardment, sieges, starvation and torture. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed.Millions more fled to neighboring countries. Abu Hussein stayed in Syria on fake papers until 2018, when he was found out, and then crossed the border into Lebanon.He moved with his brother to Burj Hammoud, a neighborhood of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, getting a job and successfully applying for residency. His passport was at Lebanon’s General Security Directorate for residency renewal when the army, along with officers from army intelligence and the information branch of internal security, descended on his house in late April.“[My brother and I] talked to the officer from army intelligence and he told us, ‘Don’t worry at all. We’re going to fix your papers, and it’s the United Nations who sent us to fix your papers,’” Abu Hussein said. He showed the officers the green slip from General Security that meant his paperwork was being processed.None of it made a difference. He was handcuffed along with his brother and held with dozens of others, including women and children, in a convoy of four or five army vehicles. The officers continued driving around Burj Hammoud and knocking on Syrians’ doors, he said, eventually moving all of the detainees to a General Security building, where their phones were confiscated.The Lebanese soldiers beat up those who resisted, he said, but the herding was the most dehumanizing part: “They treated us like cattle.”When he realized he was being sent back to Syria, he said, he told a Lebanese officer: “‘If you hand me to the Syrians, I don’t know what will become of me.’” He told me, ‘Your government can deal with you.’”An official in Lebanon’s General Security, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, told The Post there are no exact numbers for deportees because of a lack of high-level coordination within the country’s security services. When asked about Abu Hussein’s account that Lebanese forces claimed to represent the United Nations, he said: “This is a stupid question, and what an unbelievable lie.”Abu Hussein said he and his brother spent seven days on the Syrian side of the border, at two big dormitories that separated the women and children from the men. The officers handing out food and drink would issue blanket threats, he said. “They told us, ‘You’re now in Syria — we know how to deal with you.’”The Syrians conducted interrogations in the dormitories, he said, waking the men at 1 or 2 a.m. “Here, we lost hope. We thought they were taking us to put us down,” he said.Instead, he said, his interrogators pressed him on details large and small — how he got into Lebanon, the name of his cabdriver, if he had ever protested, if he had ever fought the government. “I lied about everything,” he said. “The only true thing was that I had not picked up arms” against the government.Eventually, Abu Hussein and his brother were sent back to their home province. It took intelligence forces two days to come for them there, he said.The men were ready, and had luck on their side: Living on the ground floor meant a swift escape was possible. The officers also came at 4 p.m. — unusual for Syrian intelligence, which tends to favor late-night raids.“They don’t have the fortitude for these things anymore,” Abu Hussein said cheekily.The men escaped to another province, aided by sympathizers along the way, including soldiers. “There are many people here who reject what is happening,” Abu Hussein said.He spoke to The Post by phone as he walked around the city where he is hiding. He grew quiet if he ran into passersby, and his voice dropped to a whisper when he used words like “interrogation” and “army.”“I didn’t come here with my papers, nor money, nor anything. I am standing now in the street. If a patrol passes by and stops me, I have no identification papers,” he said.If caught, he said, he expects to be charged and tortured — “and if I lived afterward, they’d send me to military service.”The Post could not independently confirm Abu Hussein’s account, but it lines up with the findings of rights groups and the accounts of others deported in recent weeks. Leila, a Syrian mother of two, said she emerged after seven days in custody on the border to find that her husband was missing. Her voice cracked with despair when she talked about him, an army defector, afraid to think of what he might be enduring in government custody. She spoke on the condition that she be identified only by her first name for security reasons.“They told us, ‘A couple hours and you’ll be back,’” she said repeatedly, returning over and over to the moment the Lebanese army knocked on their door.“Syria is still not safe for returns,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, adding that rights groups have “consistently been documenting cases of refugees returning to Syria who are being subjected to killings and forced disappearance, arbitrary detention, sexual violence and a whole host of other human rights violations.”Lebanon is prohibited from sending anyone back to a country where they are at risk of persecution, Majzoub said, citing the international “principle of non-refoulement.”The United Nations’ refugee agency, UNHCR, said it had observed “an increasing trend in raids taking place in Syrian communities” in Lebanon, including at least 73 in April.“UNHCR continues to strongly advocate for the respect of principles of international law and ensure that refugees in Lebanon are protected from refoulement,” the agency said in a statement to The Post.Abbas Ibrahim, a former head of Lebanon’s General Security, said the deportations are effectively an appeal for Western countries’ assistance: “Come and pay, come and do something for us, so that we slow down” these deportations.The West, Ibrahim continued, doesn’t support the return of Syrians but is not doing enough to help Lebanon host the refugees.“The West’s recklessness is no longer accepted,” he said, “so we want to do something to say no … come talk to us. We are the owners of this country.”",
