      "text": "BALTIMORE — On the same day and at the same track where Hall of Famer Bob Baffert returned to Triple Crown racing for the first time in two years, another of the controversial trainer’s horses broke down during the undercard of the Preakness Stakes and was euthanized on the Pimlico Race Course track.Havnameltdown, a 3-year-old colt who was the favorite in Pimlico’s sixth race Saturday, the Chick Lang Stakes, stumbled near the final turn and threw his jockey, Luis Saez. Track officials and medical personnel converged on both jockey and horse, with Saez taken off by ambulance to a hospital with an apparent leg injury, and Havnameltdown put down with what a track official called a non-operable left fore fetlock injury.Bob Baffert returns to the Triple Crown stage — and a reeling sport“We never had an issue with him,” Baffert said of Havnameltdown. “We are so careful with all these horses, and it still happens. It is something that is very disheartening. I feel so bad for that horse, and I just hope that Luis is okay.”Baffert, 70, was expected to saddle National Treasure later Saturday in the Preakness, the 13th race on the Pimlico schedule. It was to be Baffert’s first Triple Crown race since the 2021 Preakness. That same year, his colt Medina Spirit won the Kentucky Derby, but was subsequently disqualified after failing a drug test, a violation that resulted in a suspension for Baffert that kept him out of the Triple Crown races in 2022. According to a 2021 Washington Post analysis, at least 74 horses died under Baffert’s care in California between 2000 and 2021, more than all but two of hundreds of trainers operating in the state.“It’s the worst feeling,” Baffert said Saturday. “And we grieve. We do grieve when these things happen. There’s nothing worse than coming back [to the stables] and the stall is empty … He is a nice horse. He could not have been doing any better. It’s sickening. I am in shock.”Havnameltdown’s death comes on the heels of a series of such tragedies at Churchill Downs in the run-up to the Kentucky Derby earlier this month.Havnameltdown, based at Del Mar Race Track outside San Diego, carried a record of four wins in seven career starts into Saturday’s race. He was nearing the final turn when he appeared to stumble, throwing Saez from his back. The horse continued to run but was in obvious distress.He was met quickly on the homestretch by an outrider, who corralled him until medical personnel arrived on the scene. A dark screen was placed around the horse to shield the public’s view, while 100 yards or so away, a DJ continued to blast music to the small crowd gathered near the festival stage in the infield.As Havnameltdown was put down, the crowd, seemingly oblivious to the tragedy taking place on the track, danced to 2Pac’s “California Love.”This is a developing story and will be updated.",

      "title": "Analysis | Root for Mage in the Preakness Stakes, but look elsewhere for bets",
      "text": "If you are looking for a big score in this year’s Preakness Stakes, I have bad news. Mage, the Kentucky Derby winner and 8-5 morning-line favorite at Pimlico, looks legitimate. Many of the other horses in this small, seven-horse field haven’t won anything more than a maiden race — an event for horses that have not yet won a race — on a fast dirt track, and few have been able to finish among the top three after a fast pace.Odds, post positions and analysis for the 2023 Preakness StakesAs for speed, only two of the horses in the field — National Treasure and Mage — have come close to earning a final speed figure near par for races of this level. (Graded stakes winners in routes — one mile or longer — usually win with an average speed figure of at least 105.)However, Mage and National Treasure produced their triple-digit speed figures in races that were classified as fast-fast, meaning there was an above-average time to the second call (three-quarter mile mark) and final time. None of the other horses have prevailed under those conditions. The field is so meager that the prevailing joke is the race should be renamed the “Weakness.”Mage towers above the field in speed and class, leaving few quality upset choices. If you still hope to shop around, look for a horse that can press the pace and be close to the leaders at the second call, after three-quarters of a mile has been run. During the most recent winter meet at the Baltimore track, 10 of 14 winning horses in graded stakes at similar distances were within 2¼ lengths of the lead at that point. This spring, that lead at the second call shrank to 1¾ lengths.Horses expected to be in the mix at the second call Saturday, aside from Mage, include Blazing Sevens, Coffeewithchris and National Treasure. Of those, only National Treasure appears to have a real chance at pulling an upset. Unfortunately, he should be the second choice in the race.Placing a win bet in this race is going to be tricky, but using a personal odds line can ensure you get the value you need to justify going to the window. A personal odds line involves ranking your best horses and assigning your contenders a combined 80 percent chance to win, with the non-contenders earning the remaining 20 percent. In this case, I would narrow the list of contenders to Mage, National Treasure and Red Route One, in that order. Mage is going to be such a popular choice it will be nearly impossible to get value on him in the win pools. If you assign him odds of 8-5 on your personal odds line, you are saying he has an almost 40 percent chance to win, which uses half of your 80 percent allotment for contenders. That would make the other two contenders 4-1 on your personal odds line. If you are thinking the odds you need won’t allow a win bet, well, you would be right. This might be a pass in the win pools.The exotic payouts also will be suppressed if Mage wins as an overwhelming favorite in a small field, which is smaller still when you factor in the legitimate contenders. There will be too many trifecta (pick the first three finishers in order) and superfecta (pick the first four finishers in order) tickets with Mage at the top plus National Treasure in the place slot. Your only hope for a big payout with Mage winning is two long shots finishing second and third, and that feels too difficult for this group.There is one scenario worth exploring that could lead to a nice return on investment, and it involves a fast pace that breaks down, allowing a closer to pass tired horses in the stretch. To take advantage of this possibility, you would single Red Route One on top of the two main contenders — Mage and National Treasure — in a trifecta. You might even add Perform as a candidate for show. You could improve your return by not using Mage at all.The best bet of all, however, might be to pass on the race entirely. I know that’s boring, but in a race with little value, it’s probably the right thing to do.",

      "title": "At the PGA, ‘Double Trouble’ No. 6 lays a deep leader board to waste",
      "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. — All golf majors are real, but some are realer than others, and this 105th PGA Championship looks like one of the realest. The Oak Hill course has hogged praise in Meryl Streep amounts. The leader board promises weekend hyperventilation, brimming with major winners and at least one absolute, positive, definite, can’t-miss future major winner, Viktor Hovland, who stood tied for the lead at 5 under par with Scottie Scheffler and Corey Conners, among 18 players within five shots of the front, including Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy.There’s even a starring hole: No. 6.“I mean, 6 is probably the hardest hole I’ve ever played,” Scheffler said.No. 6 flirted Friday with becoming the hardest hole in PGA Championship history, surging ahead of its 17 brethren in difficulty with stats that could drop a golf-geeky jaw. By early evening, this 503-yard, par-4 barbarian had allowed three birdies, 63 pars, 63 bogeys, 24 double bogeys and three other things too profane to detail. At one point it had played to 102 over par, with second-place No. 7 at 43 over par, before that gap narrowed somewhat to 117-66 after an afternoon rainfall shooed the wind.PGA Championship leader boardFrom behind, this hole dubbed “Double Trouble” bears a sign telling how an “army of 3,000 French and Indians crossed these grounds twice in July 1687.” From the right side, it has a native area of unkempt mud and weedy reeds where Dustin Johnson visited for a penalty shot early Friday and a duck milled around with her 11 ducklings late Friday. From the left side, it has a grandstand serving the kinds of products often necessary for viewing such carnage. At the tee late Friday lay two crumpled beer cans — presumably not from players, but you never know.“I think 500 yards into the wind with water by the right and by the green, it just makes for a tough hole,” said Phil Mickelson, who will play the weekend after sneaking in on the cut line of 5 over.“It’s crazy difficult,” said Mito Pereira, the Chilean who almost won this thing last year in Tulsa and who stands six shots off the lead. Asked whether it’s fair, he said: “Today, I don’t know. I mean, it’s playing pretty long.”“The length, first of all,” said Conners, the 31-year-old Canadian in his 18th major with three top 10s, all at the Masters. “The tee shot is difficult. If you get in the rough, you have no chance to go for the green, pretty much. Even if you hit the fairway, you really can’t hit the green in two, so it’s just a hard hole.”The funny thing about that is that a sixth hole at Oak Hill once qualified for the pushover hall of fame. That happened at the 1989 U.S. Open, where the No. 6 of that time happened to be the 167-yard par 3 that staged one of the most remarkable sequences in golf history: four holes-in-one from among the first 33 players on the Friday of that event (Doug Weaver, Mark Wiebe, Jerry Pate and Nick Price). As Rick Reilly wrote in Sports Illustrated at the time: “And you know that somebody sitting at the 6th hole was seeing golf played for the first time: These guys aren’t so great. A lot of ’em don’t even make it.”And with course redesigns also art forms, the one Andrew Green fashioned here from 2015 to 2019 has gotten its nods.“I was really, really impressed” upon first sight, Conners said. “I thought it’s a spectacular test of golf. It’s demanding.”“It’s just a good, hard, fair test,” Mickelson said.“You get rewarded for good shots out here,” Scheffler said, “and if you execute, you can birdie pretty much any hole. Granted, it’s going to take two pretty incredible golf shots to do that, but it can be done.”Old Oak Hill, born in 1926 before serial makeovers all the way into its dotage, seemed to be trying hard to reward excellence as Scheffler and Conners went 67-68 while Hovland went 68-67. It had Scheffler, the 2022 Masters champion, a winner twice this year and ranked second in the world; Bryson DeChambeau, the 2020 U.S. Open champion two shots back after his gut-it-out 71 with a double bogey on No. 6 followed his opening 66; long-promising American and former Southern California Trojan Justin Suh at 3 under, two from the lead; and then more shine just below.Here came Koepka, the four-time major winner who grimaced at his own waywardness Thursday but then parred the entire front nine and birdied five times on the back nine, just about all of it with textbook accuracy for birdie putts of six, six, 11, 13 and six feet. His great 66 left him at 2 under. There stood habitual contender Justin Rose, at 1 under after his 69-70 on the par-70 track. Here came 2019 British Open winner Shane Lowry, who birdied six of the eight holes between Nos. 8 and 15 before two closing bogeys left him at even par.And writhing around back there alongside Lowry and seven others at even par, was that Rory McIlroy? That was Rory McIlroy. He birdied No. 18 from 16 feet and felt something approaching amazement.“I think how terribly I’ve felt over the golf ball over the last two days,” he said, “the fact that I’m only five back — yeah, not saying I could be up there with one of my best performances, but when I holed that putt at the last, I looked at the board, and I thought, I can’t believe I’m five back.”They all went toward a weekend forecast of rain and suspense, with only nine players under par and a course grudging in its fairness. “It’s exciting,” said Hovland, still just 25, “but you have to focus on every single shot you are hitting. Your mind can easily start to wander, and you hit a bad shot because of that, and now suddenly it’s not as exciting.”That might go double at Double Trouble.",

      "title": "Josh Harris’s Commanders deal contains ‘earnout’ payment to Daniel Snyder",
      "text": "Josh Harris’s $6.05 billion deal to purchase the Washington Commanders from Daniel Snyder includes an “earnout,” a structure that would provide Snyder with a deferred payment of an amount contingent on the franchise reaching specified financial benchmarks, according to five people with knowledge of the terms of the sale.The earnout represents a relatively small but perhaps meaningful portion of the overall sale price. Its inclusion in the deal explains, in part, why people familiar with the deliberations of the NFL finance committee last week described the sale agreement between Harris and Snyder as unusually complex.The finance committee raised issues during its 2½-hour meeting last week in New York and continues to have concerns about Harris’s deal. One person with knowledge of the committee’s conversations said this week that the amount of debt in the deal is, in the committee’s view, significantly above the NFL’s $1.1 billion limit for team acquisitions.The committee plans to continue to work with Harris’s group to structure the deal, that person said. But the differing views between the Harris group and the finance committee about the deal’s current form — and its compliance with NFL rules — point to a potentially long and perhaps difficult process that is likely to extend well beyond the owners’ meeting scheduled for Monday and Tuesday in Minneapolis. The deal ultimately must be approved by the finance committee and ratified by a vote of at least 24 of the 32 owners.“There’s a lot of work to do,” one person familiar with the NFL’s inner workings said in recent days.Josh Harris’s Commanders deal nears the finish line but isn’t there yetThe deliberations are playing out while the NFL may be making progress with Snyder on the issue of indemnification, one person with knowledge of the sale process said. The Harris deal represents the only option before the league and the owners for getting Snyder out of the NFL. The announcement Friday that the deal — previously sent to the league as an unsigned, nonexclusive agreement — had become signed and exclusive prompted a celebratory reaction by many Commanders fans.“Everyone wants this to work,” one person with knowledge of the finance committee’s conversations said. “There’s no doubt about that. But it has to comply with the rules. It has to be under the debt limit.”The earnout may have been used as a mechanism during the negotiations to push the sale price above Snyder’s $6 billion target after Harris’s group was unwilling to bid that much. One person with knowledge of the process said the payout could be as much as approximately $200 million, though the Harris group could end up paying much less. The exact business-related benchmarks on which the amount of the payment are based were not immediately clear. The inexact nature the payment amount also signals that the $6.05 billion sale price might not be fixed.The Harris group declined to comment through a spokesman.A member of the Rivkin Radler law firm, writing last year on the legal website JD Supra, described an earnout as “a form of contingent, deferred consideration that is often utilized to reconcile a difference of opinions between the buyer and the seller regarding the fair market value of the target business as of the date of the closing.”Multiple sports financial advisers said such a structure would be common and well-accepted in most business settings in a deal of such magnitude but is extremely rare in sports-franchise sales. The NFL has a highly restrictive set of rules related to franchise sales, and the league generally prefers to deal with a lead owner in a prospective ownership group with overwhelming wealth and access to cash.David Tepper and Rob Walton bought the two most recent NFL teams to sell. Tepper, a prominent hedge fund manager, has an estimated net worth of $18.5 billion, according to Forbes. He paid $2.275 billion for the Carolina Panthers in 2018. Walton, a Walmart heir, has an estimated net worth of $61.6 billion and bought the Denver Broncos last year for $4.65 billion.Harris, a private equity and sports investor, has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $5.9 billion. He owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils.NFL finance committee has concerns about Josh Harris’s Commanders dealNFL ownership rules require the lead investor of an ownership group to have at least a 30 percent equity stake in the purchase. No ownership group can exceed 25 people or borrow more than $1.1 billion to buy a team. And no private equity firms, public corporations or sovereign wealth funds can own any shares. Analysts have said those rules may have to change, given the soaring NFL franchise values, but they are not expected to be modified for this transaction.Josh Harris has a signed, exclusive deal with Daniel Snyder for CommandersThe Harris group believes its deal is in compliance with NFL ownership rules, people connected to the process have said. They say the group also believes there should be no questions about the liquidity of Harris and his investors, given their combined net worth above $100 billion.According to the person with knowledge of the finance committee’s deliberations, the committee’s view that the deal is far above the NFL’s debt limit is a far greater concern to the league and committee than anything related to the earnout. That person expressed the view that Harris and investor Mitchell Rales — the co-founder of the Danaher Corporation — have the financial wherewithal to structure a deal that would satisfy the committee but have yet to do so.According to that person, Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, the chairman of the eight-owner finance committee, has vowed the committee will continue to “work with” the structure of the deal. Hunt declined to comment last week in New York following the finance committee’s meeting.It’s not clear exactly what about the deal’s structure produces differing views regarding its compliance with the debt limit. But such issues can be subjective. When Howard Milstein withdrew his bid for Washington’s franchise in 1999, the finance committee reportedly regarded a $150 million loan to Milstein and his brother from their father as a loan; Milstein’s backers had contended it was equity. That resulted in Snyder buying the team from the Jack Kent Cooke estate for $800 million.The stakes are high for both Harris and the NFL. Harris’s group would have to pay a breakup fee if the deal falls through, according to a person familiar with the sale process. It’s not clear how long the Harris group has exclusivity to attempt to have the deal approved and close it. The NFL owners paused consideration of a vote to remove Snyder from ownership of the Commanders to allow the sale process to play out.The league still must resolve issues with Snyder’s representatives related to legal indemnifications and the NFL’s second investigation of Snyder and the Commanders. One person with knowledge of the league’s inner workings expressed hope that the indemnification issue can be resolved, saying that Snyder “is starting to come around” to potentially agreeing to an approach acceptable to the NFL and other owners.Owners are expected to be updated on the Commanders sale during next week’s two-day meeting in Minneapolis. Several people close to the process said they see little to no chance of the owners taking a ratification vote next week.",

      "title": "Choppy ice, tired legs and pizza: A look at the NHL’s longest games ",
      "text": "The Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes played the sixth-longest game in NHL history Thursday night, a 3-2 Panthers win in four overtimes that took 139 minutes 47 seconds of ice time to complete and ended at 1:54 a.m. Eastern.In honor of the latest Stanley Cup playoff marathon, which gave the Panthers a 1-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference finals, here’s a look at the longest games in NHL history.Matthew Tkachuk ends the sixth-longest game in NHL history1936 Stanley Cup semifinalsWe have to go back 87 years for the longest game in NHL history, which mercifully ended when Detroit’s Mud Bruneteau scored at 16:30 of the sixth overtime. With 116:30 of overtime, the teams nearly played the equivalent of three full games, beginning on March 24 and ending around 2:30 a.m. on March 25. According to the NHL, Red Wings goalie Normie Smith lost 12 pounds of body weight during the game as he unofficially made 92 saves (shots were not yet an official NHL statistic).Keep in mind that Zamboni ice-resurfacing machines were not used by NHL teams until the mid-1950s, so the rink at Montreal Forum must have been a disaster as the game wore on.1933 Stanley Cup semifinalsThree years earlier, the deciding game of a best-of-five series between Toronto and Boston lasted so long that the morning papers began to be sold at Maple Leaf Gardens.After a goal by the Bruins’ Alex Smith was disallowed by an offside call in the third overtime, and after another scoreless 20 minutes in the fourth, the teams’ general managers decided that the game would be decided by a coin flip. After all, the ice was extremely chopped up and the Maple Leafs were playing with numerous injured players. But players from both teams protested the decision and the game staggered on until Toronto forward Ken Doraty — all 135 pounds of him — beat Boston goalie Tiny Thompson at 4:46 of the sixth overtime and 164:46 of total play.“We wanted to play until somebody won legitimately,” Thompson said. “It didn’t matter to us if it took all night, and it nearly did.”2000 Eastern Conference semifinalsThe longest modern-day NHL game (92:01) — which took place two days after a single-overtime Game 3 — ended in the fifth extra period when Philadelphia’s Keith Primeau lumbered up the ice, cut inside to shake Pittsburgh defenseman Darius Kasparaitis and put one past Penguins goalie Ron Tugnutt on the short side.Flyers center Daymond Langkow nearly ended the game just 31 seconds into the first overtime, but his shot hit the crossbar. As the overtimes piled up, things started to get a little desperate as the players tried to keep up their energy between periods.“Usually on the road the team orders pizza for the locker room,” Primeau said. “There’s pizza for the guys, power gels, power bars, they were really popular. The trunk of those was gone, the pizza was gone. Trainers are going up to concession stands to see if there’s anything there. [The] coaches’ popcorn was eaten.”Said referee Rob Shick: “We had the standby ref order pizza after I think it was the second or third [overtime] because we didn’t even know if we could get anything to eat after the game. In those days the teams didn’t really supply us with anything to eat. Back then we got nothing. We were lucky to get a couple rolls of tape. The problem is we had one of our standbys who’s probably the guy with the biggest appetite on our staff, and he ate three-quarters of our pizza.”2020 Eastern Conference first roundThe 2020 playoffs were played under quarantine conditions in empty arenas because of the coronavirus pandemic, and its very first game was this drawn-out affair between Tampa Bay and Columbus that ended when Lightning forward Brayden Point beat Blue Jackets goalie Joonas Korpisalo at 10:27 of the fifth overtime.Point was so tired after 150:27 of hockey that he could barely get off the ground while trying to jump in celebration.“Finally, one goes in. I think that’s the emotion,” he said. “Just super-excited.”Korpisalo was beaten on the game’s final shot but set an NHL playoff record with 85 saves, snapping the mark of 73 set by the New York Islanders’ Kelly Hrudey in a four-overtime win over the Washington Capitals in the 1987 Patrick Division semifinals. The teams combined for 151 shots on goal, the most in a playoff game since that statistic began being officially tabulated in 1959-60.2003 Western Conference semifinalsAnaheim entered Game 1 of the 2003 Western Conference semifinals having already played two overtime games — and four overtime periods — in its first-round sweep of the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. It added four-plus more extra periods in its opening game against Dallas, which ended when Petr Sykora scored 48 seconds into the fifth overtime.The Ducks led 3-1 in the second period but surrendered two goals, the last coming with just 2:47 left in regulation when a deflection by Brenden Morrow tied the score. Anaheim thought it had won the game in the third overtime when the puck went in off Steve Thomas’s leg, but the officials ruled that the net had become dislodged and waved off the goal.Naturally, the next game also went to overtime, though the Ducks ended it after only 1:44 of extra time.2023 Eastern Conference finalsFlorida’s Matthew Tkachuk barely prevented a fifth overtime Thursday night, beating Carolina goalie Frederik Andersen with 12.7 seconds left in the fourth extra period. It was the Panthers’ fifth overtime game of the playoffs, and they’ve won every single one of them.The game appeared to end early in the first overtime, but Carolina successfully challenged a goal by Florida’s Ryan Lomberg, with the officials ruling that Colin White interfered with Anderson on the shot. The Hurricanes’ Seth Jarvis also nearly ended things later in the first extra period, but his shot rang off the crossbar.In case you were wondering, the longest Stanley Cup finals game took place in 1990, when Edmonton defeated Boston, 3-2, on Petr Klima’s goal at 15:13 of the third overtime in Game 1.",

      "title": "Capitals give defenseman Alex Alexeyev a two-year extension",
      "text": "The Washington Capitals ­re-signed defenseman Alex Alexeyev to a two-year contract extension Tuesday, keeping the 23-year-old Russian in the fold as the team looks to solidify its blue line for next season and beyond.Alexeyev’s one-way contract, which is worth $775,000 next season and $875,000 in 2024-25, had been considered a priority for the front office and was one of the first moves in what is expected to be a transformative offseason for the team after it missed the postseason for the first time in nine seasons.While the Capitals continue their search for a new coach who will be able to connect with their veteran core, they are also looking for a leader who can help develop younger players such as Alexeyev, who was set to become a restricted free agent this summer. He is projected to be one of Washington’s primary six defensemen next season.Carl Hagelin, still recovering from injuries, isn’t ready to walk awayAt 6-foot-4 and 213 pounds, Alexeyev is a big, physical presence who showed flashes of promise on the blue line for Washington late in the season. After undergoing shoulder surgery last summer, Alexeyev worked his way into the lineup late in March and logged heavy minutes as the Capitals endured attrition through injuries and dealt multiple defensemen at the trade deadline. Alexeyev averaged just over 16 minutes of ice time and finished with five assists in 32 games. He also tied for fifth on the Capitals in blocked shots per 60 minutes (5.46).Alexeyev is the second young Russian player in the organization to earn a new contract in as many days. On Monday, the Capitals signed 19-year-old forward Ivan Miroshnichenko, the team’s 2022 first-round pick, to a three-year entry-level contract worth $855,000 in the NHL. That deal came after Miroshnichenko moved on from the Kontinental Hockey League, where he played last season.Washington also added a potential future depth piece last month in defenseman Hardy Haman Aktell, a 2016 Nashville Predators draft pick who signed a one-year, two-way, entry-level contract with the Capitals after shining in the Swedish Hockey League last season.Alongside right-handed veterans John Carlson, Nick Jensen and Trevor van Riemsdyk, Washington has three left-handed defensemen who are just 23 years old and figure to be in the top six next season: Alexeyev, Rasmus Sandin and Martin Fehervary, who is a restricted free agent this summer and could be next to receive an extension as Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan looks to strengthen the defensive corps.“I think we could still improve it a little bit. We’ll look at opportunities to do that,” MacLellan said last month. “I like the right side, what they’ve contributed. They all have roles they fill within our team, and they all do it well. The left side, we’ve got three 23-year-old guys that are all looking to improve and get better and get to the next level.”",

      "text": "The NFL paid tribute to one of its greatest players and most towering figures Friday, as league leaders and fellow Hall of Famers expressed their admiration for former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown after his wife announced he died Thursday night in Los Angeles at age 87.“Jim Brown was a gifted athlete — one of the most dominant players to ever step on any athletic field — but also a cultural figure who helped promote change,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a statement. “During his nine-year NFL career, which coincided with the civil rights movement here at home, he became a forerunner and role model for athletes being involved in social initiatives outside their sport. He inspired fellow athletes to make a difference, especially in the communities in which they lived.”Brown was named to the NFL’s 100th anniversary all-time team in 2019. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971..@nflcommish statement pic.twitter.com/b2hz4dwuXU“When Jim Brown’s name was announced in a room, other Hall of Famers stood and applauded him,” Jim Porter, the Hall of Fame’s president, said in a statement. “His persona has stood the test of time — a fearless and dominant football player. Jim will always be remembered as one of pro football’s greatest individuals. … The Hall of Fame will honor his legacy for years to come.”The flag at the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, will be flown at half-staff in Brown’s honor.“There isn’t a man who played running back in the NFL who didn’t see Jim Brown as an iconic legend on and off the field,” fellow Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett wrote on Twitter. “Rest easy, my brother.”Jim Brown, Hall of Fame running back and actor, dies at 87Another all-time great at the position, Barry Sanders, wrote on Twitter: “You can’t underestimate the impact Jim Brown had on the NFL. He will be greatly missed. Additionally, his generosity and friendship with my family is a gift that we will always treasure. Our thoughts [and] prayers are with the Brown Family [and] Browns fans at this time.”“To the world he was an activist, actor, and football star,” Brown’s wife, Monique, wrote on Instagram. “To our family, he was a loving and wonderful husband, father, and grandfather. Our hearts are broken.”Brown was named the NFL’s MVP three times. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his nine NFL seasons and held 15 league records, according to the Hall of Fame, when he retired in 1966 at 30.Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay wrote Friday on Twitter that Brown was “THE greatest ever.”The Cleveland Browns wrote in a statement it is “impossible to describe the profound love and gratitude we feel for having the opportunity to be a small piece of Jim’s incredible life and legacy. We mourn his passing, but celebrate the indelible light he brought to the world. Our hearts are with Jim’s family, loved ones, and all those he impacted along the way.”We are heartbroken by the passing of the legendary Jim Brown.One of the greatest players in NFL history, a true pioneer and activist. Jim Brown’s legacy will live on forever. 🕊️ pic.twitter.com/byBcZ0c7KGBrown was a prominent actor and social activist after leaving football.“Jim’s presence, his ability to relate to all people, to guide people, to have leadership and perspective on so many things in life is really incredible,” New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, who formerly coached the Browns, told ESPN last year. “I would kind of put him in a class by himself there.”Former Jacksonville Jaguars running back Fred Taylor wrote Friday on Twitter: “It was an honor to meet and speak with [Brown] over the years. His comments regarding my career are the only forms of validation that ever really mattered to me. [No.] 32 is THE GREATEST to EVER TOTE THE [football]: Rest in Heaven JB!”",

      "text": "With just half a minute left in a Stanley Cup playoff game at Las Vegas on May 6, Golden Knights defenseman Zach Whitecloud took a check from behind. It was unnecessary. The game was decided, with Edmonton up three. So Whitecloud turned and slashed the arm of the offender, Oilers forward Klim Kostin, then shed his gloves and began to fight.That was what you would expect of a 6-foot-2 athlete who weighs maybe half a stone over 200 pounds, playing in a adrenaline-fueled collision sport sometimes still governed on the ice by fisticuffs.What you would not expect of such a man was what Whitecloud did a few days later.But he is Native. First Nations. Born and reared in Brandon, Manitoba, a city about 30 miles from the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation reservation of a little more than 1,000 people. He considers it home. The reservation knows him as its son. Its council even picked up Whitecloud’s costs to play travel hockey as a kid. Sioux Valley Dakota is quite proud of its first son to make it to the NHL.So when Whitecloud was apprised of ESPN announcer John Anderson making fun of his name while narrating highlights of the Las Vegas-Edmonton series, he spoke to Anderson — “In our culture, we were raised to be the first ones to reach out and offer help,” Whitecloud explained — and then faced the media about the affront.He spoke haltingly for a little over five minutes. It was painful for him. It was equally agonizing to watch. At least if you have a heart.“I’m proud of my culture. I’m proud of where I come from, where I was raised and who I was raised by,” Whitecloud said. “I carry my grandfather’s last name, and nothing makes me more proud than to be able to do that.”But emotion began to overcome him. So he bowed his head and excused himself from the scrum to seek, as you could only imagine at that moment, some solitude.Sticks and stones may break bones, but it was never true that words don’t hurt. They scorch. They impale. They damage.It has been close to 20 years since the American Psychological Association cited growing scientific evidence as grounds to abolish our very American practice of appropriating Indigenous names and employing our imaginations of Native culture for sports. Its reason? Doing so is particularly harmful to Native children’s identity and self-esteem. And it’s damaging to the rest of us because it informs us that to be indecent toward others is something it never is — okay.But a clinical diagnosis, a data dump, is hard to see and impossible to feel. What was revealed with Whitecloud was real. You saw it. You felt it. It was emotive.“What they did with Mr. Whitecloud was mock his name, which is even worse,” Ronald F. Levant, a now-retired psychologist who as president of the APA in 2005 issued its famous declaration, told me Friday.And how Whitecloud reacted, Levant said, “illustrates the depth of the hurt he was subjected to.”Yet Whitecloud, 26, is in his fifth season in the premier hockey league in the world, where he must play against a franchise the league allows to use the image of a Native man’s head as its logo and a Native name as its moniker.Sports should do better and can do better. But in just the past two weeks, we were reminded that sports can be as insensitive to the marginalized as ever.West Virginia Hall of Fame men’s basketball coach Bob Huggins spat homophobic remarks Monday toward a Catholic university’s fan base during an appearance on a Cincinnati radio station. His employer suspended him three games, trimmed $1 million off his annual salary and amended his contract from a multiyear deal to a year-by-year agreement.Barry Svrluga: With slur, Bob Huggins showed what he thinks. No apology can change that.Longtime Oakland A’s TV broadcaster Glen Kuiper uttered the racial slur for Black folks during a broadcast this month while discussing a visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City. It was explained as a slip-of-the-tongue. Kuiper was removed from further broadcasts while NBC Sports California, which carries A’s games, reviews the incident, which to me sounded as if it was taking the public’s temperature. The internet, always undefeated, found what sounded like a second similar utterance from Kuiper.Kansas City won the Super Bowl again amid protests from Native people to stop offending them with its name and fan hand gesture it calls the “Tomahawk chop,” which Kevin Gover, Pawnee and the undersecretary for museums and culture at the Smithsonian, in my film “Imagining the Indian: The Fight Against Native American Mascoting,” emphatically assures Native people don’t do.And the Atlanta baseball team shows no signs it will stop using its illusory name for Native people, employing a tomahawk as a logo and encouraging its fans to mock Native people with the chop despite Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley, who is Cherokee from Tahlequah, Okla., pleading with Atlanta during the playoffs a few years ago to, just, stop.“It’s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,” Helsley said then. “Just depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren’t intellectual. They are a lot of more than that.”Making fun of Native people is part of Atlanta’s fan experience at its home games. Its executives should watch Whitecloud’s news conference.And in and around Washington, D.C., after all the local NFL franchise has done to debase itself, suck the lifeblood out of its fan base yet finally rid itself of the last chapter of its racist past, some people, including in the media, have raised the specter of reviving the team’s racist old name. Incredible.“With this comes an opportunity to allow … everyone to learn from this incident,” Whitecloud said, “ … move forward and make sure that these things don’t happen again.“It’s just time for everyone to learn.”",

      "title": "Yankees Domingo Germán suspended 10 games after sticky stuff ejection",
      "text": "Major League Baseball on Wednesday suspended Yankees right-hander Domingo Germán for 10 games after he was ejected from Tuesday night’s game for using too much sticky stuff. The 30-year-old will not appeal the ban, which he will begin serving when the Yankees play the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday night.Germán held the Blue Jays scoreless and struck out two in the first three innings on Tuesday. When umpires checked his hands before the fourth, they said they found something sticky. Crew chief James Hoye later told a pool reporter that Germán’s was the “stickiest hand I’ve ever felt.” Germán later told reporters he had only used rosin.“It was not rosin,” Hoye told the pool. “I’ve felt hands with rosin and it definitely was not rosin. It was extremely sticky. Rosin is usually a little tacky. This was sticky. My fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.”Yankees starter Domingo Germán has been ejected for having an illegal substance pic.twitter.com/hq9aIPo5DXThe suspension will likely cost Germán two starts.The ejection came in the midst of a dramatic series between the American League East rivals. In Monday’s opener, cameras caught Aaron Judge looking to the side just before hitting a gargantuan homer. Toronto broadcasters speculated Judge and the Yankees might have been stealing signs. Blue Jays pitcher Jay Jackson told the Athletic on Wednesday that he was tipping pitches, meaning Judge may well have been looking for a signal for someone — like his first base coach — watching for the tip.Stealing signs like that, provided no electronics are used in the process, is legal. But the subject is sensitive. Every team is trying to pick up patterns in their opponents’ signs, but every team feigns the same offense when they are victimized.The Blue Jays’ dugout asked umpires Tuesday night to ensure Yankees third base coach Luis Rojas stayed inside his coach’s box — as if to suggest that the reason the Yankees could steal signs was because their coaches were positioned illegally. Later in the evening, the Yankees asked umpires to do the same thing with Blue Jays third base coach Luis Rivera.No evidence has surfaced to suggest that added checks on Germán were a part of the Blue Jays’ revenge plan. Germán was ejected during a routine check, not one asked for by a manager. But Germán might have been wise to exercise caution anyway: almost exactly a month ago, he found himself on the brink of a similar expulsion at the hands of the same umpire.During the third inning of a game against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, Hoye checked the righty’s hand and told him to wash it between innings. When Germán came out for the fourth inning, Hoye found some rosin remaining on his pinkie finger. He was allowed to stay in the game.“He was warned. He didn’t fully comply I would say with the warning from what I was told,” Twins Manager Rocco Baldelli told reporters after the game. “When he returned and it was still on there partially, on part of his hand, I didn’t think there was really any question he should be removed from the game.”A week later, Max Scherzer became the third player ejected under MLB’s fortified sticky stuff rules. Scherzer did not appeal his suspension, though he did lodge an informal public protest, arguing that he had only used legal substances. League rules state that while rosin is legal in its simplest form, it can be combined with other substances to reach a level of tackiness that would qualify as illegal. Just how much tackiness qualifies as illegal is up to the umpire. And a month after their first encounter, Hoye and his crew determined Germán’s hands were too sticky this time around.",

      "title": "Wizards hoping for a little magic in the NBA draft lottery",
      "text": "For the second year in a row, Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. will don a suit, climb the stage and hope for the best as he serves as Washington’s representative Tuesday in the NBA draft lottery at Chicago’s McCormick Place. The Wizards are vying for the right to draft French phenom Victor Wembanyama with just the eighth-best odds (6.7 percent) and must be crossing their fingers, hunting for four-leaf clovers, cradling fuzzy dice — whatever it takes to attract a little bit of long-overdue good luck.Drafting Wembanyama would provide a supersized injection of hope into a forlorn franchise already on the precipice of change. Washington is in the middle of a search for a new general manager and is sending Unseld onstage while assistant general manager Brett Greenberg represents the team behind the scenes in the drawing room. If they move up to win Tuesday, that top job gets a lot more enticing.First, they’ll need a heap of good karma.Which NBA lottery team needs Victor Wembanyama the most?Since the NBA began using a weighted lottery system to award the No. 1 overall pick in 1990, the team with the eighth-best odds or worse has jumped up to claim the top spot just four times. In 1993, the Orlando Magic pulled off a stunner by leaping to the top spot despite having the lowest odds to win (1.5 percent); the team drafted Chris Webber, then dealt him to the Golden State Warriors for Penny Hardaway. In 2008, the Chicago Bulls jumped from ninth (1.7 percent) to draft Derrick Rose with the No. 1 overall pick. In 2011, the Cleveland Cavaliers won the lottery with the eighth-best odds (2.8 percent), and in 2014, they moved up again, from ninth (1.7 percent), to grab the top slot and draft Andrew Wiggins (they then traded Wiggins for Kevin Love).The Wizards haven’t been as fortunate; they’ve been mired in an unfavorable streak that was extended last month when, after finishing the season 35-47, they slid to eighth place instead of seventh in the lottery when they lost a coin toss tiebreaker with the Indiana Pacers. That’s bad enough that Unseld might want to find former Cavaliers general manager and current New Orleans Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin to rub shoulders with before the drawing Tuesday night and steal some of his mojo.Washington has either stayed planted at its expected position or moved down in 18 of its 21 trips to the lottery since 1990. The worst-case scenario Tuesday is slipping to 12th, and there is a smidgen of a chance it does so — those odds are listed as just over 0.0 percent. The odds the Wizards fall to 11th are a mere 0.4 percent.The Wizards and Knicks GM Scott Perry: An ideal fit hiding in plain sightTheir last big leap was when they moved up from eighth to third to nab Otto Porter Jr. in 2013.If you’d rather turn your gaze to something sunnier, there are friendlier odds to focus on: according to Tankathon.com, the Wizards’ odds to jump into the top four are 29 percent. Though Wembanyama is a singular talent, he is one of several exciting players available in this class. Moving into the top four would put the Wizards in range to select G League Ignite point guard Scoot Henderson, Alabama forward Brandon Miller or perhaps either Amen or Ausar Thompson, the pair of identical 6-foot-7 twins who played with Overtime Elite this year.That would be fortuitous enough. The formidable gifts all of those prospects bring on court pale — at least right now, in this uncertain moment in Wizards-land — next to the hope they symbolize. If that sounds like a corny line from a superhero movie, well, Washington is in need of saving. Its roster needs are up in the air until owner Ted Leonsis hires a general manager. Kyle Kuzma will hit free agency this summer, and Kristaps Porzingis’s future with the team is uncertain because he has a player option for next season. A refreshed front office may take Washington in a new direction, or it may hunker down around Bradley Beal — or Beal could request a trade. The only thing the Wizards know they need for sure heading into Tuesday is luck.",

      "title": "Perspective | The Preakness is coming, and all of horse racing holds its breath",
      "text": "BALTIMORE — It was brisk, almost bracing, on the Thursday morning before the Preakness Stakes when Mage came off the final turn, an easy gallop for a pre-9 a.m. workout at Pimlico Race Course. The dirt flew behind him. The front stretch laid out ahead. Whether he had a care in the world, he didn’t say. Certainly didn’t look like it. Beautiful, almost breathtaking animals, these thoroughbreds.Mage won the Kentucky Derby, and when the Preakness goes off Saturday evening, he will be the heavy favorite in the second leg of the Triple Crown. But after a tragic meet at Churchill Downs that again shook a creaky sport to its core — seven dead horses over 10 days, with little connective tissue as to how or why — the more important news Saturday will be less about who won the race than whether the eight animals asked to run 1 3/16th miles all make it back to the barn in good health. A sport, for now, holds its breath.“He behaved perfectly,” said Gustavo Delgado Jr., the Venezuelan who works closely with his father, Mage’s head trainer, after the workout. “Did everything right. Then when he came back, he looked more professional today than yesterday. And on his way back to the barn he was calm and collected.”That’s not really this sport at this moment, calm and collected. The people who own these horses and care for these horses and love these horses say time and again how well they’re cared for, and in a blanket sense, that’s true.“They’re like their kids,” said Chase Chamberlin, half of a partnership that owns a quarter of Mage. “They really are.”Dark week at Churchill Downs sparks questions about horse racing’s futureBut would parents ask their children to participate in an activity that results in 1.25 deaths per 1,000 starts? That’s the number the Jockey Club, a trade organization, cites as the equine fatality rate for racehorses in 2022 — which is an improvement, the lowest since the organization started keeping track in 2009.There is so much at work here, and it’s so easy for vultures to swirl when horses fall in such numbers — as they did at Santa Anita in 2019, when the California track lost 30 horses in the winter and spring and then another in the high-profile Breeders’ Cup Classic that November. But it’s hard to marry the notion that those who know the sport from the inside are open to — and in fact push for — changes to how horses are medicated and evaluated for competition, when some of those same people have fought against such standards. Horse racing and the general public have a trust problem, and it’s well-earned.Consider this: When Congress brought forth a bill known as the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act in 2020 — after the spate of deaths at Santa Anita — associations and state officials in Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia sued to strike the measure down. A path to progress?The objections were mostly around logistics — who would have power to oversee what. The optics stunk. The result is that new anti-doping and medicine control standards have been delayed by more than a year. Legal haggling has them going into effect … Monday, two days after the Preakness. There is, too, this backdrop: Two of the sport’s most decorated trainers, Hall of Famers Todd Pletcher and Bob Baffert, have been suspended by racing authorities in New York and Kentucky, respectively, for positive drug tests in their horses.This is the best the sport has to offer, trailed by suspicion and pleas for understanding?“Our horse’s care comes first,” Chamberlin said Thursday, and he no doubt means it.“One breakdown is too many,” he said. “It is a very rare occurrence. I think there’s an element of, everybody needs to keep their side of the street clean. That’s one way to start.”But what about the owner in the next stall? If the general public looks askance at statements like that — knowing horses have been drugged, knowing horses have died, and knowing some within the sport have pushed back on change — who can blame them?“We have this HISA organization that is trying to get off the ground, and our own horsemen are fighting it,” said longtime Maryland-based trainer Graham Motion, who won the 2011 Kentucky Derby with Animal Kingdom. “That is such a shame. We have got to evolve with the times, and we need national organization. They have to give this a chance.”Odds, post positions and analysis for the 2023 Preakness StakesThere is, for now, no known link among the deaths that led up to the Kentucky Derby. But what is undeniable is that, even in good times, these horses are massive, 1,000-pound animals riding at great speeds with human beings on their backs. They are, at the same time, incredibly fragile and incapable of describing their aches and pains.“An athlete comes off at halftime of the Super Bowl and says, ‘My ankle is killing me,’ and you can handle that as you want,” Motion said Thursday by phone. “He’s got a choice whether you treat the ankle, or he gets pulled out of the game. We have the responsibility of looking after the horses, and they can’t tell us what hurts. We have to figure that out.”And when a horse can’t speak for itself, a vet must make the call. That’s what happened to Derby favorite Forte, trained by Pletcher, who was scratched in the hours before the race because state racing commission veterinarian Nick Smith thought the horse was affected by a bruised foot.“We’ve all been in that situation,” Motion said. “It’s just magnified 100-fold when it’s the Kentucky Derby. I’m sure that it’s something that any other day of the week, it would have been acceptable. But with the pressure that’s on our sport on that day, and the eyes of the world are watching, you have to sympathize with the veterinarians who just have to be incredibly cautious.”So here comes the Preakness, in which Mage is the only Derby horse who will run just two short weeks later. That’s the first time in 54 years that just one horse who ran the Derby will run here. That’s caution — understandably.“I don’t think there’s any trainer who’ll tell you he’s 100 percent sure that he’s not going to regret that kind of thing,” Delgado Jr. said. “ … But all the signs … that we wanted to see in order to take this chance are there.”Go to any betting window at Pimlico, and that’s what you’re taking: A chance. What the sport of horse racing says it doesn’t want to do is to take chances with its athletes — equine and human — or its future. Hold your breath for the racing to be over, and for long-awaited change to come.",

      "title": "Perspective | After a rocky Game 1 loss, Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla could use a timeout",
      "text": "BOSTON — The expectations for a Boston Celtics title run are evident around TD Garden. The most visible reminder has to be the big, bold billboard plastered outside the building that reads: “Unfinished Business.” The message evokes the memory of the Celtics falling two wins short of a championship a year ago. Adding even more emphasis: Two of the letters within the slogan are designed to look like a “1″ and an “8.”There are also obvious reminders that the Celtics are chasing the franchise’s 18th championship banner with a rookie coach. It comes up when Joe Mazzulla gets face time with a national audience, as he did Wednesday when TNT announcer Kevin Harlan served up the in-game coaching interview with the introduction: “The youngest head coach in the NBA.” Mostly, however, the indicators of Mazzulla’s inexperience emerge every time Boston takes a step back in its title pursuit, as it did by dropping Wednesday’s opening game of the Eastern Conference finals to the eighth-seeded Miami Heat.Mazzulla, 34, inherited a championship-ready team but not the accompanying respect. His decisions get dissected and, worse, second-guessed. Even by some of the paying customers, who plead from their seats for him to call a timeout — a favorite gripe that hangs over Mazzulla and one he seems done talking about.Jerry Brewer: Nikola Jokic is now, Victor Wembanyama is next and the NBA is worldwideBut after the Celtics lost, 123-116, on Wednesday night, largely because of a third-quarter collapse in which they surrendered 46 points, Mazzulla couldn’t escape his least favorite topic. After the game, reporters asked variations of the same question. Pretty much: Hey rookie, why didn’t you do anything to break up the Heat’s 21-12 run until nearly the midway point of the quarter?“Get better shots, don’t turn it over, and don’t foul, don’t give up offensive rebounds and don’t give up threes,” Mazzulla said, choosing to answer literally a question about what could have been done to stop the run.And when asked how he balances letting the game play out vs. calling a timeout, Mazzulla, clearly annoyed, responded tersely while dodging the query.“I called two in the first quarter,” Mazzulla chirped.For the fourth time this postseason, the second-seeded Celtics lost at home. Mazzulla didn’t turn the ball over multiple times in the final quarter as all-NBA player Jayson Tatum did. And though he didn’t allow the Heat to shoot 51.6 percent from the arc (16 for 31), he will shoulder the majority of criticism for the Game 1 setback. Such is the life of a rookie coach who was given one of the best teams in the NBA — and the pressure of not messing it all up.We all know the story by now. Mazzulla shouldn’t even be in this position. Last year when Ime Udoka, himself a rookie coach at the time, formed the Celtics into a championship-caliber team, Mazzulla was an assistant stationed behind the bench. In October, however, the team suspended Udoka for having an improper relationship with a team employee and promoted the little-known coach from Rhode Island. The regular season went smoothly — the Celtics won 57 games, and Mazzulla finished third in voting for the league’s coach of the year honor.The intense young coach practices jujitsu, plays prison-style ball with his coaching staff and allegedly watches “The Town” four times a week — charming stories, though it was all the wins that helped build Mazzulla’s credibility. Those wins also made people forget — or not care — that Mazzulla prefers to give his veteran team the freedom to figure things out. The Celtics have two of the top 15 players in the league in Tatum and Jaylen Brown; Marcus Smart, last season’s defensive player of the year; and Malcolm Brogdon, this season’s sixth man of the year. Also: Robert Williams III, the lob threat and paint protector, and the respected O.G. of the bunch, Al Horford.Inside the NBA draft lottery room: Heartbreak for the WizardsThe team is stacked, and Mazzulla has been smart enough to stay out the way, declining to call timeouts when his players hit rough patches. Even when he does stop the action, Mazzulla doesn’t appear to dominate a huddle. At times Wednesday, despite being allotted 3 minutes 30 seconds in a timeout, Mazzulla would keep it moving, spending as little as 15 seconds actually addressing players on the sideline.However, even that brief amount of communication would have been greeted with applause had Mazzulla called for time as Boston’s nine-point halftime lead dwindled away. He instead chose to wait until the 6:28 mark. The lead vanished while Miami seized control of the third quarter and ultimately the game. During that timeout, Mazzulla tossed his clipboard and walked away from the huddle.“Joe is real big on a lot of times not bailing us out on stuff when we’re playing like s---. So we’ve got to look ourselves in the mirror. Joe can call a timeout, and then what, we come out and do the same thing? It’s on us,” Smart said. “Joe and his coaching staff, they put in a lot of work to come up with a game plan and put us in the right spots to succeed, but they’re not out there playing. We’ve got to come together, and we’ve got to start helping each other out on both ends.”After the game, Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra could sit in peace. He wasn’t asked about his timeout usage. He didn’t face any pointed questions from the media about lulls in his team’s performance. No second guessing whatsoever.This tranquility, of course, had everything to do with his team winning on the road. His postgame media session was so easy, so full of respect, that at one point a reporter even attempted to ask Spoelstra about the potential of becoming only the second No. 8 seed to make the NBA Finals — though the Heat still has the arduous task of winning three more times for that scenario to play out.Across the back corridors of the arena, where the coach of the home team sat and stewed, there were no inquiries about the upcoming Finals. Mazzulla, whose curt and defensive responses to reporters’ questions have not helped his cause, faced another interrogation about his choices and his coaching style. Following that media session, Mazzulla walked out, grabbed his backpack, a to-go box of fruit and walked down the hallway with his wife. For a few minutes, at least, the only questions he confronted were inside his own head.",

      "title": "Perspective | Jim Brown was a confounding knot of athleticism, activism and violence",
      "text": "Spend five minutes around Jim Brown, and you would swear he was the baddest man on the planet. There was no way to prove it, of course, but you didn’t dare question the feeling, not while being near him.Talk about presence. When he shook your hand, it felt like he was cracking open a walnut. For so much of his life, he seemed to age without weakening, an enduring vision of strength. Even though he spoke slowly, he commanded attention because of all the wit, insight and audacity flowing from his deep voice. He had a growl as he searched for the right words. And when he found them, he delivered his thoughts with his signature, unmistakable trait: conviction.Brown, who died Thursday at age 87, was an immovable star. He thought he was right even when he was wrong, and he was wrong a lot — abusively wrong and unforgivably wrong at times. As a football legend, actor and civil rights activist, Brown enjoyed a life full of iconic moments, but when considering all of him, he wasn’t really an icon. He was Jim Brown. Jim. Brown. And there was little anyone could do to stop him.He was one of the 10 most important athletes ever to put on a jersey. It doesn’t do Brown justice to consider him only the most dominant running back in NFL history because, in college at Syracuse, he was also a lacrosse superstar in addition to lettering in basketball and track. He went to the NFL in 1957 and won three MVPs in nine record-breaking seasons with the Cleveland Browns, flashing his athletic collage of speed, power, agility and fearlessness. And then he left after the 1965 season, retiring from football officially at 30 years old, to focus on his acting career and to fight harder for African Americans seeking equality during a volatile period in American history.“I could have played longer,” Brown told Sports Illustrated of his decision, which he announced while filming “The Dirty Dozen” in London. “I wanted to play this year, but it was impossible. We’re running behind schedule shooting here, for one thing. I want more mental stimulation than I would have playing football. I want to have a hand in the struggle that is taking place in our country, and I have the opportunity to do that now. I might not a year from now.”And that was it. Brown was done. He didn’t attempt a comeback. He didn’t entertain the idea, except for when he talked about the possibility in 1983 because Franco Harris was getting close to his rushing record. Brown was 47 at the time. Those who watched him win eight rushing titles probably wouldn’t have doubted his ability to play at that age. He was from another time, and even though the game has evolved from the run-dominant era that he owned, Brown still looks on film like the rare player who could transport to today, 60 years later, and be a premier player without overhauling his style.At 6-foot-2 and 230 pounds, Brown would be a slightly smaller Derrick Henry with even more game-breaking, big-play ability and a hand-eye coordination that also would have made him a dangerous receiving threat in a pass-happy league. Consider that Henry, in seven seasons, has three receiving touchdowns. In his nine seasons, Brown had 20. In 1962, in addition to his customary production running the football, Brown led Cleveland in receptions and receiving touchdowns. And he played on a broken toe the whole season. He did whatever he wanted on a football field.He wanted to be just as free away from the game, and in pursuing such liberties for himself, he wanted to uplift his entire race, too. His approach was different from others’, which led to controversy when Brown embraced Donald Trump after he became president. He believed in self-empowerment and didn’t spend much energy on protest. He spoke his mind, but he tried to leverage his celebrity to convince civic leaders to support his causes, including the Amer-I-Can organization that he founded in 1988. For more than 30 years, the program has made an impact in the United States and abroad by helping gang members and prisoners recast their lives, but as Brown grew older, it became harder to fund it. Now his wife, Monique, will be left to maintain a key part of his legacy.In a 1979 interview with The Washington Post, Brown explained his goals and how he wanted to be known.“I was a symbol of a Black man who wanted all of my freedoms,” he said. “It’s very difficult for White America to understand that if you are part of football’s elite why you are not satisfied with recognition and good money. … As an American citizen, I wanted the same rights as all Americans. Anyone who expected me to be overjoyed that I was doing well in football would be disappointed.”From the famous 1967 Cleveland Summit with Muhammad Ali and several prominent Black athletes of that era to his persistence in fighting for what he believed in, Brown did plenty to challenge and better society. But he shouldn’t be remembered in the same way as Bill Russell, who died last summer. Brown’s history of domestic violence, mostly against women, tarnishes any perception of him as a hero.He was arrested at least seven times for assault. In 1968, police suspected that Brown had thrown his girlfriend, Eva Bohn-Chin, off his second-story balcony in Hollywood. Bohn-Chin claimed that she fell accidentally and declined to testify, leading to the dismissal of an assault charge.From the archive: Jim Brown, serving time on his own termsDespite numerous incidents and vile accusations, Brown avoided significant jail time. This is a difficult period in which so many revolutionary sports figures are exiting the world, and in Brown’s case, parts of his life were as ugly as the bigotry he overcame. His defiance was necessary and toxic all at once. There’s ample evidence that the strength many admired in his celebrity transformed into a violent temper in private. It’s a wicked juxtaposition that makes everything about Brown, even appreciating him as a cultural figure to be reckoned with, difficult to capture.Throughout his 87 years, Brown kept making people uncomfortable. It was entertaining. It was courageous. And it was dishonorable. In one famous life, every facet of celebrity was twisted into the most confounding knot.Now Brown is gone, an exit that feels as sudden as his departure from the NFL. Before the Super Bowl in February, I can’t remember ever looking at Jim Brown and thinking he was old. Then there he was at the NFL Honors, appearing frail. He wasn’t a specimen or a symbol anymore. He was vanishing.The immovable, complicated star finally budged.",

      "title": "The NFL says owners will not vote next week on the Commanders sale",
      "text": "NFL team owners will not vote on the prospective approval of Josh Harris’s $6.05 billion deal to purchase the Washington Commanders from Daniel Snyder at their meeting next week, the league said Thursday.“There will be an update for the membership on the purchase and sale agreement that we saw last week, I guess it was Friday,” Jeff Miller, the league’s executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy, said in a video news conference. “There are not going to be any votes at this time. League staff and the finance committee will continue to review the details of the transaction, as they would in the normal course.”The NFL finance committee has raised issues about the structure of Harris’s deal. The committee considers the deal to be well above the NFL’s $1.1 billion debt limit for a franchise purchase, one person familiar with its deliberations said this week. The Harris group believes that the deal is in compliance with all NFL ownership rules, people with knowledge of the sales process have said.Josh Harris’s Commanders deal contains ‘earnout’ payment to Daniel SnyderThe deal is vetted by the eight-owner finance committee, which then makes a recommendation to the owners. The sale must be approved by a vote of at least 24 of the 32 owners; they generally follow the recommendation of the committee. The owners meet Monday and Tuesday in Minneapolis at their regularly scheduled quarterly meeting. The NFL did not provide a timetable Thursday for a possible ratification vote.“The transaction was just submitted to the league,” Miller said. “The purchase and sale agreement was just agreed upon, I guess, Friday. So there’s work that goes into that. As I mentioned, staff is doing that work now [and will] present that to the finance committee in the normal course. And after that, there will be a vote, I would imagine, of the full membership. So [there’s] nothing special or out of the ordinary. [It’s an] ordinary process, as we would for any other transaction of its sort.”The owners’ next scheduled meeting, after next week’s, is in October. The NFL could schedule a special meeting for the owners to vote on the Commanders sale, as it did last August when the owners approved Rob Walton’s $4.65 billion purchase of the Denver Broncos.“I don’t really know how to compare it against other transactions,” Miller said. “But the process is the same. We have staff working on it. Any transaction like this is important. It deserves due process. We will certainly go through it and do it as expeditiously as we can. Since the parties have an agreement, that’s our responsibility. Our responsibility is to share it with the finance committee and for them to understand it before we go to the full membership.”NFL finance committee has concerns about Josh Harris’s Commanders dealPeople familiar with the NFL’s inner workings and the views of the owners have said the owners would like to make the deal with Harris work to remove Snyder from the league’s ownership ranks with as little additional rancor as possible. But the finance committee must be convinced that the deal complies with the debt limit, they say, requiring further work with the Harris group on the structure.The then-tentative deal was submitted to the league for an informal review last month even before it became signed and exclusive last Friday, although two people connected to the process said Thursday the final version of the sale agreement contained significant changes from the tentative deal.The NFL also is in conversations with Snyder’s representatives, people familiar with those discussions have said, about issues related to indemnification and the league’s investigation of Snyder and the team being conducted by attorney Mary Jo White. The NFL reiterated Thursday that it will release the findings of White’s investigation publicly.“Nothing has changed there,” Miller said. “Once she completes her review, we’ll release the findings of it, as we’ve said for some period of time. And [there’s] no other news to report there.”",

      "title": "Anthony Mantha’s ‘crazy tough’ season was a struggle. He got a mental coach to help. ",
      "text": "When Anthony Mantha was scratched for the first time with the Washington Capitals back in January, it was a wake-up call. It was difficult to imagine a player of Mantha’s status reaching that low: A 2013 first-round pick who was once a key part of the Detroit Red Wings’ rebuild before the Capitals traded for him two years ago to bolster their own lineup, Mantha was always among the most physically gifted players in any game he played. And he was certainly among the most handsomely paid, carrying an average salary of $5.7 million into this season.But the wake-up call from this winter lasted months. Mantha, 28, was a healthy scratch for a string of games before the all-star break, and by the time he returned to the Capitals for the second half of the season, his confidence was low. He scored just two goals in his final 28 games. He was demoted in the lineup, and his playing time dipped. He gave up a costly turnover that led to a game-winning goal by Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin in a heartbreaking loss that all but sealed Washington being eliminated from postseason contention for the first time in nine years.“It was crazy tough,” Mantha said. “Being scratched is hard. … You come back and try to get things going and get your confidence. Sometimes it’s way harder than people can imagine.”Now Mantha sits at a crossroads. He has one year remaining on his lucrative contract, and while he doesn’t know if he will be moved this offseason, he has vowed to return to Washington for training camp “with some fire just to prove to everyone that I can do the job.”As Mantha struggled through the scratches this season, he started to work with a mental coach through a company in Toronto. His confidence did return after the first several sessions. Even as he was struggling through one of the most difficult periods of his career, it allowed him to make short-term gains. “It’s making commitments, making decisions, making goals,” he said, which he hopes will lay the groundwork for the offseason and better equip him for handling the mental rigors of professional hockey next season.“Players need help with the mental part of the game. It’s hard to handle all the ups and downs,” Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said. “You have to be a mature guy to brush some of the stuff off that’s being said about you and come out and compete and get to your highest level. I think various personalities and types of players can handle that better than others. Some need help; some don’t need help.”Mantha had arrived for training camp last year facing heavy expectations and vowed to play all 82 games. His previous campaign had been marred by shoulder surgery and a lengthy rehab. Mantha started strong, posting three goals in his first five games. But as he struggled through an early-season slump, former Capitals coach Peter Laviolette tried him on different lines and on the second power-play unit, neither of which sparked his game. When he was scratched for the first time in January, Mantha said, concerns about his work ethic and not his offensive production led to the decision. By the end of the season, he continued to take responsibility for underwhelming performance and downplayed any tension with Laviolette.“I don’t think it’s anything between us. I think it’s just me, myself to blame,” said Mantha, who finished with 11 goals and 16 assists in 67 games. “Maybe my lack of skating or my lack of shooting or my decision-making. . . . It takes a toll on your confidence. And then after that, you’re just looking for your game that maybe’s not present.”He will spend the offseason trying to rediscover that game. Mantha works out with a group of NHLers over the summer, including New York Rangers star Alexis Lafrenière. He plans to spend extensive time competing in a three-on-three league. And he will continue to work with the mental coach he hired during his difficult season.“It’s not the season I wanted. I want to come back here and prove to everyone, including myself, that they came to get me for a reason,” Mantha said. “That’s exactly my mental state of mind.”",

      "title": "Women’s basketball just had a moment. Can the WNBA build on it?",
      "text": "Rhyne Howard said the quiet part out loud this week. The WNBA’s 2022 No. 1 overall pick and reigning rookie of the year took to social media to express a dichotomy within the league that has frustrated many who follow the game.The league wants to capitalize off the record-breaking viewership from the Final Four and NCAA national championship game. At the same time, some of those players who were drafted after proving hugely popular during those games were waived this week before Friday’s season opener.Howard broke it down:“Ugh, this is stressful,” Howard tweeted in the final line.WNBA fines Aces, takes first-round pick and suspends Becky HammonA consistent goal of the WNBA has been to grow its fan base. There have been positive trends in recent years; 2022 was the most-watched regular season in 14 years, with viewership up 16 percent from 2021. The league just held its first preseason game in Canada and sold out Scotiabank Arena, where the NBA’s Toronto Raptors play. Now there’s an opportunity to build off a women’s NCAA tournament that had the most viewers on ESPN for the national championship game, Final Four, Elite Eight and Sweet 16.“They’ve adopted a new audience to consume their game, and this was not a traditional women’s college basketball audience,” said Phil Cook, the WNBA’s chief marketing officer. “It’s audiences of sports who love competition, love rivalries, love quality of play on the court, love tension. I think there’s a rising tide lifting all boats in the world of women’s basketball that we are definitely leaning into.”Commissioner Cathy Engelbert added: “Now we have to make sure we take these great players and, as they come into our league, we continue to market them, put the marketing dollars behind them. . . . Now we’ve got to bring those fans along with us.”Cook said athlete storytelling — through marketing and the media — is central to attracting and growing the WNBA’s audience. But there’s a challenge in doing so with popular incoming players. The league has just 12 teams and 144 roster spots, and with the limited opportunities, even the top young players can have trouble making teams.Emily Engstler, the No. 4 pick from the 2022 draft, was waived by the Indiana Fever and Washington Mystics recently. Former Maryland guard Abby Meyers, the No. 11 pick in 2023, was waived by the Dallas Wings during training camp. Alexis Morris, Brea Beal and Elena Tsineke, all 2023 second-round picks, were waived. Morris became widely popular playing for champion LSU, as did Beal for 2022 champion South Carolina. Monika Czinano, who was a star as Iowa reached the championship game, was drafted 26th but waived by the Los Angeles Sparks.The list goes on.Not only are these players widely popular from their exploits on the court, but with NIL now a part of the college landscape, many are coming in with established brands and large social media followings. Rabid fan bases such as LSU’s will follow former players such as Morris simply because they’re Tigers. When those players don’t make the league, those potential fans can fall to the wayside.The Mystics don’t think the WNBA title chase is a two-team race“The talent is there. We just need more teams,” said Christine Franklin, executive vice president of marketing at Octagon, a sports and entertainment agency. “From a business perspective, that expansion opportunity feels really ripe given the talent and the pipeline of players coming in from the NCAA. There does need to be some person or strategy to get those NCAA players to the bench of the WNBA quicker. How do those top 10 to 20 players make it that first year? Because that’s not happening right now.”Still, the interest in the WNBA is in a good place and the league had a popular offseason with player movement, particularly in Las Vegas and New York. Many have dubbed the Aces and Liberty as super teams, with defending champion Las Vegas adding two-time MVP Candace Parker and two-time champion Alysha Clark and New York acquiring a pair of MVPs in Jonquel Jones and Breanna Stewart, along with four-time all-star Courtney Vandersloot.Plus, Brittney Griner’s return to the Phoenix Mercury after she missed last season while being detained in Russia for 10 months is highly anticipated. She already was one of the faces of the league but became a national story as President Biden worked to bring her home. Now there will be even more people following her efforts throughout 2023 and beyond.The WNBA also installed marketing deals that give players an opportunity to earn money away from the court. This past offseason, the league sent Napheesa Collier (Connecticut), Arike Ogunbowale (Notre Dame) and Kelsey Mitchell (Ohio State) to attend games at their alma maters and interact with fans and boosters to promote the league.“I think it’s really more on the networks to step in and step up in terms of investment of what they create in and around the playoffs and the tournament,” said Camille Buxeda, Octogon’s director of women’s basketball. “This is setting up an incredible table for Cathy and her team at the WNBA to begin negotiations with different networks [before] the next [collective bargaining agreement]. This is all the leverage in the world that Cathy and her W team can really utilize to take to these networks and help them understand.”At emotional news conference, Brittney Griner mostly looks forwardThat may be the biggest opportunity for exponential growth. The WNBA airs games on several platforms, including Ion in a new deal, but ESPN and ABC remain the largest platforms for national games. WNBA games and the NCAA tournament have had strong numbers on major networks. A new deal after the one with ESPN expires in 2025 should give the league an influx of cash and the chance to get in front of more eyeballs.Liberty and Brooklyn Nets co-owner Clara Wu Tsai recently made the point while discussing a new documentary about the inception of the WNBA during an appearance on “Good Morning America.”“There’s been so little media coverage around women’s sports,” Tsai said. “Even though there’s a very proven appetite for women’s sports, only about 5 percent of all sports coverage is on women sports. There’s just such a lack of storytelling, and I really wanted to bring some national attention to the league and to these amazing athletes.”",

      "title": "Angels employee imprisoned for Tyler Skaggs’s death files an appeal",
      "text": "Eric Kay, the former Los Angeles Angels communications director convicted of giving pitcher Tyler Skaggs the drugs that caused his death in 2019, argued in an appeal filed Monday that prosecutors misstated evidence and failed to prove the charges that sent him to prison for 22 years.Kay’s attorneys claimed that in securing his conviction last fall for drug conspiracy and distributing a controlled substance resulting in death, the government never proved Kay actually gave Skaggs the pill prosecutors said killed him.In the brief Monday, the lawyers argued that prosecutors misled the jury by claiming that Kay was Skaggs’s only source for drugs, that no evidence had been deleted from Skaggs’s phone following his death, and even that indentations on a hotel room couch were evidence Kay was there — and did nothing — while Skaggs died. Those claims and others were debunked through court testimony and evidence, Kay’s attorneys argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.“Tyler Skaggs’s death was tragic,” wrote Kay’s attorneys, led by Texas attorney Brett Ordiway. “There’s plenty of blame to go around: cartels that flood American streets with camouflaged fentanyl; physicians who recklessly prescribe powerfully addictive narcotics; Skaggs himself, a grown man who chose to crush and snort illegally obtained pills; and yes, Eric Kay, who helped nourish Skaggs’s addiction. But the Government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kay gave Skaggs the drugs that caused his death.”Kay was convicted by a jury within three hours following a trial made sensational by the testimony of several of Skaggs’s former teammates, including one-time star pitcher Matt Harvey, who stated Kay had previously supplied them with oxycodone — though there was no evidence he did so for profit. Court testimony showed that Kay, himself a drug addict, initially lied to police about whether he was aware Skaggs also used drugs. After initially stating he felt the mandatory 20-year minimum sentence for the charges was “excessive,” District Judge Terry Means added on two years because of unremorseful comments Kay made in recorded phone conversations from jail.Skaggs’s family has sued the Angels, claiming the team allowed Kay “unrestricted access” to players despite knowledge of his drug abuse. Rusty Hardin, an attorney for Skaggs’s family, said Monday in response to Kay’s appeal: “The jury got it, Eric Kay and the Angels continue not to.”The Angels declined to comment on Kay’s appeal. The team has denied the allegations in the lawsuit filed by Skaggs’s family.In the appeal brief, Kay’s attorneys argued the government relied on thin, circumstantial evidence to show he bought the deadly pill in California and then gave it to Skaggs after the team arrived in Dallas on a road trip on July 1, 2019.Kay’s attorneys argued cell phone data used by the government as evidence he met with a suspected drug dealer in fact only showed they were within a few miles of each other. Skaggs texted Kay his room number the night of his death, which prosecutors seized on as evidence Kay brought him the pill.But Kay’s attorneys argued the version of events he shared with a coworker was just as likely: that Kay “arrived emptyhanded and Skaggs offered him a crushed-up line,” which Kay then declined to snort. Kay did not testify in his own defense at trial.A prosecutor also told the jury Skaggs’s only source for drugs was Kay and there was no evidence messages were deleted from Skaggs’s phone after he died, despite testimony contradicting both claims, Kay’s lawyers argued. As for the “depression” on a couch in Skaggs’s room that a prosecutor suggested was evidence Kay sat there, Kay’s attorneys argued a police officer testified he had not seen “any wrinkles in the cushions or anything indicating that anyone had sat there.”Following the verdict, one of Kay’s trial attorneys was disbarred in a separate matter. Kay has claimed that when prosecutors initially offered him a plea deal that could have gotten him released in five years, his other trial attorney “belittled him for considering it and threatened to withdraw from the case” if he accepted, according to the appeal brief. Kay, 48, is serving his sentence at FCI Englewood, a federal prison in Colorado, with a release date in 2041.",

      "title": "Carl Hagelin, still recovering from injuries, isn’t ready to walk away",
      "text": "After he packed his gear and said goodbye to his Capitals teammates at Washington’s practice facility this month, Carl Hagelin emerged from the dressing room and leaned against a wall near the rink.The Capitals’ veterans were giving interviews behind the team’s bench, but Hagelin talked in front of a few cameras off to the side. He had been driven to the shadows by four surgeries in the past year, including an operation that restitched the pupil in his left eye and another that resurfaced his damaged right hip. There were reminders of his injuries everywhere, even on breakdown day, when he glanced out at the rink.“I haven’t been on the ice yet,” he said, “but I'm thinking by the time July comes around, I want to skate really hard.”Hagelin eventually nodded up at the industrial fluorescent lights that hung above him.“It kind of messes the eye up a little bit,” he said, “but with a tinted visor, it feels a lot better.”He remains almost defiantly positive in his outlook, refusing to listen to those who expected him to give up the game after suffering his catastrophic injuries over the past 13 months. Hagelin has instead been emboldened after doctors were able to save his right eye and after he watched Nicklas Backstrom become one of the rare professional athletes to return from a hip resurfacing this past season.Hagelin has already built a respectable NHL career: The 34-year-old was once among the league’s fastest skaters, has logged more than 700 games in 11 seasons and won two Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Returning to the NHL with a permanently damaged eye and a metal hip would perhaps be his greatest accomplishment.“My goal is to play again,” Hagelin said. “My hip needs to feel good, though, to do it. It kind of comes back to that. I need to get 2½ really good months on the ice skating … and at that point, if it feels good, I want to play in the NHL again.”Hagelin hasn’t played in a game since he suffered his eye injury while battling for a puck during a practice in March 2022. A stick whacked him in the face and ruptured the choroid in the back of his left eye.In the days after, doctors wondered whether they would have to remove the eye; they eventually salvaged it by restitching the pupil. He regained only partial vision in that eye. It no longer dilates, and Hagelin struggled with depth perception early in his rehabilitation. He started to work with Keith Smithson, an optometrist based in Reston who has helped Washington Nationals pitchers, to recalibrate his brain and learn how to compensate with the limitations of his vision. Even though he wasn’t cleared by the team, he returned day after day for rehabilitation, clawing for progress.“He’s been in a tough position almost a year and a half,” captain Alex Ovechkin said, “but I never saw a guy who was [so] passionate about hockey. He came here every day working hard, give us the positive emotions.”That would have been enough to jeopardize any NHL player’s future, but Hagelin was also dealing with perpetual pain from his hip, an ailment he first started feeling in 2020. Even as he recovered from his eye injury, he returned to training camp last year and felt discomfort in his hip.“Like I had a knife going into my groin,” said Hagelin, who eventually underwent hip arthroscopy last September. “I think when I had the scope right away, they knew it wasn’t a home run. My hip was really messed up.”When that procedure didn’t get him back on the ice, he chose to do what teammate and Swedish countryman Backstrom had done the year before — he got his hip resurfaced. Hagelin knew it would further jeopardize any chance at a return, but he was encouraged not only by Backstrom’s return from the operation but by others in the sports world who had done the same, including tennis star Andy Murray.“It was interesting to watch the Andy Murray documentary; he’s back playing, running side to side … looking pretty good. And then Backy obviously getting 40 games this year. … I think players are ready and athletes are ready to put in the time nowadays to really get back at it,” Hagelin said. “I think it’s more that you’re at a point in your life where, when you’re older, some people just say, ‘Hey, it’s time to give up at this point.’ But obviously Backy is a great example.”Said Backstrom: “He is one of those guys that works hard and is eager to get back out there.”To do it, Hagelin will need to string together a few months of solid skating this summer before he regains his strength. Once that happens, he will sit down with his agent and see what his options are.He’s clearly antsy to get back on the ice. Hagelin took part in the team’s official photo this month, getting dressed in his uniform for the first time all season. When the session was over and his teammates left the ice to get ready for practice, Hagelin remained by himself, taking a little twirl on his skates. It was the first time he had been on the ice since his hip surgery.“I think I’ve always kind of lived in the moment. You know, bad things happen. I’m fortunate to be playing this sport,” he said. “I’ve always been positive and kind of see the bright side of things.”",

      "title": "Mystics make a powerful opening statement, thump Liberty",
      "text": "Elena Delle Donne looked Breanna Stewart in the eye, gave her a pump fake from the perimeter, then drove past her for a layup. Seconds later, Delle Donne blocked Stewart’s jumper, triggering a Washington Mystics fast break.As WNBA watchers imagined rich possibilities after the New York Liberty added a pair of MVPs in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, the Mystics reminded everyone that they have their own two-time MVP, and she looks plenty healthy. Delle Donne pushed the Mystics to a lead midway through the first quarter, and they never trailed the rest of the way, cruising to an 80-64 victory in the season opener Friday night at sold-out Entertainment and Sports Arena.The Liberty and the Las Vegas Aces, the two betting favorites for the WNBA title, have been called “super teams” based on their seismic offseasons. After the Mystics dismantled New York in the opener, guard Natasha Cloud took issue with the notion of a two-team title race.“Y’all can keep sleeping,” Cloud said. “We’re confident in what we have in this locker room. And you can continue to talk about the superhero teams, but we know who we are, and we know what we bring every single night. We know what we have in this locker room, and everyone eats.“So we’re not going to be perfect. We’re going to be damn sure close to it, though. I’m excited, so keep sleeping on us.”Women's basketball just had a moment. Can the WNBA build on it?The Mystics’ offseason was more quiet, focusing on finding depth and building a defensive foundation. Nearly everyone put their fingerprints on this game in one way or another.Delle Donne finished with 13 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and the block on Stewart while playing a team-high 33 minutes. Cloud posted 14 points, six rebounds, six assists, two blocks and a steal. Brittney Sykes, the Mystics’ biggest offseason signing, had nine points, nine rebounds, five steals and three assists. Kristi Toliver (10 points), Tianna Hawkins (eight), Shakira Austin (six) and Shatori Walker-Kimbrough (six) all delivered key moments.“I’m not surprised,” Delle Donne said. “It’s our identity as a team. It’s what we’ve been doing in training camp. And we don’t care about the outside noise. We don’t care about the storylines. It’s not going to change how we show up every single day, take care of one another and get the work we need to get done each day.“This has been the identity of this group, just a gritty, hard-working group that loves each other.”The defense swarmed throughout, holding the Liberty to just 26 points in the first half. Sabrina Ionescu scored a game-high 18 points but on 7-for-20 shooting. Stewart (12 points) and Jones (five) were a combined 5 for 16 from the field. The Mystics forced 20 turnovers, 13 of them steals.New York looked like a team with a lot of new pieces that still has to grow and build chemistry. The Liberty also missed some easy looks early in the contest.The Mystics have a true coach on the floor in Kristi Toliver“It was a great effort,” Coach Eric Thibault said. “I thought we played really, really hard. I thought we were really active defensively. They’ve got really good ballhandlers and playmakers, and we forced a lot of turnovers.“The team that we had wanted to be through camp showed up. So that was satisfying.”Here’s what else to know about the Mystics’ win:Mike Thibault has sat in the first seat on the Mystics’ bench since he joined the organization in 2013, but that changed Friday. Thibault stepped down as coach but remains the Mystics’ general manager. So he sat in the front row at center court with his wife, Naci.Eric Thibault slid over one seat as the new coach and walked into the postgame news conference drenched in water after a locker room celebration. He said he looked up once and saw his father yelling at the same time as he was.“I expected more jitters out of him,” Delle Donne said. “He was real calm. He’s certainly ready for this moment.”Jones spent her first six seasons with the Connecticut Sun after being the No. 6 overall pick in the 2016 draft. Stewart was the No. 1 pick in that draft and played her first six seasons with the Seattle Storm.“It’s refreshing, honestly, to be able to play for a different coach, just like a different mind-set,” Jones said. “Sometimes you get so used to a place, and of course you get comfortable, but there’s certain parts of your game that probably aren’t growing anymore because of that.“I really relish stepping into new roles, new opportunities and also learning from somebody else that has been successful in this league for such a long time.”Stewart said she still says Seattle sometimes when people ask about her team.“Change is good, and change is also challenging,” Stewart said. “In order for us to continue to grow as individuals, as players, as people, sometimes you need to put yourself in a different environment. … Also realizing that we want to do something that this franchise hasn’t done and that’s win and really get the city behind us.”The Mystics travel to meet the new-look Connecticut Sun on Sunday at 1 p.m. The Sun lost Jones and coach Curt Miller but added Tiffany Hayes and Tyasha Harris and Stephanie White as coach.",

      "title": "Analysis | The AL East, MLB’s best division, might be even stronger than you think",
      "text": "The Tampa Bay Rays have dominated this baseball season from the opening weeks, when they became the fourth team in MLB history to start 13-0, joining the 1884 Maroons, 1982 Atlanta Braves and 1987 Milwaukee Brewers. The Rays have won a lot more since then, and are on pace for 120 wins, a total that would eclipse the 116-win record held jointly by the 2001 Seattle Mariners and 1906 Chicago Cubs.Not only are the Rays winning, they’re dominating their opponents. As of Thursday morning, Tampa Bay had scored 122 more runs than they allowed, the highest run differential in baseball and 35 runs better than the Texas Rangers, who ranked second. After finishing 25th out of 30 teams in home runs last season, the Rays have hit a league-leading 86 home runs. Only the 2000 St. Louis Cardinals and 1999 Seattle Mariners had more home runs during their first 43 games of the season. The Rays are on pace to easily break the single-season record of 307, set by the 2019 Minnesota Twins.In almost any other year, that kind of performance would be enough to run away with a division title, but this year’s American League East is far too strong for that. In fact, it seems poised to be one of the strongest divisions in recent memory.The four other teams in the division — the Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox — are all over .500, the only division able to pull off that feat this season. (As of Thursday morning, the AL West was the only other division with even three teams at or above .500.) The Orioles, who trailed the Rays by 3½ games as of Thursday morning, would be leading every other division. But the raw win-loss records, impressive as they are, actually don’t do the division justice. It is even stronger than it looks on paper.Durability was Max Scherzer’s superpower. Not so much these days.Since baseball realigned the divisions in 2013, moving the Houston Astros to the AL and giving each league 15 teams, the combined win rate for the 2023 AL East is the highest of any division at this approximate point of the season (a combined .620 after each team played 40 games). The division had a plus-207 run differential at the teams’ collective 40-game mark, almost double that of the 2020 NL West (plus-118), the next best division since 2013.The NL Central had the second-highest collective run differential (plus-18) at the 40-game mark this season, a mere fraction of what the AL East did to opponents. This year’s AL Central, by comparison, had a minus-165 run differential after each of its members played 40 games. The largest run differential by a division since the latest realignment was established in 2021 by the NL West, whose teams outscored opponents by 443 runs. The pace this year’s AL East is on, a projected run differential of plus-838, would obliterate that mark.Run differential provides a great overall view of baseball’s best teams, but an even better way to judge the landscape at the team level for a single season requires looking at baseruns, a measure of how many runs a team should have scored or allowed given its underlying offensive and defensive performance. The math behind baseruns can be daunting, yet because it removes the effects of sequencing — the order in which particular outcomes occur — from performance, it gives us a better valuation at the team level.Here’s a simple illustration of how and why it works. A team draws four walks in a nine-inning game. If those four walks were issued consecutively in a single inning, it will create a run. But if those walks were spread out over four different innings, they might have no impact on the scoreboard.We can take it a step further and use the expected statistics for each team to derive baseruns. These expected stats use underlying metrics like exit velocity and launch angle to determine the likelihood of a hit, further stripping away any good or bad luck a team might be experiencing from the inputs into the baseruns formula. For example, the Kansas City Royals are batting .234, but we would have expected an average of .249 based on balls in play, per data from TruMedia. So instead of 275 base hits, we can give Kansas City credit for 293 in the formula. Next, we can adjust each team’s performance via baseruns for strength of schedule, also known as a simple ranking system, showing us how many runs per game above or below average each team should be scoring this season. Then it is a simple exercise to rank the teams to get the best and worst MLB has to offer in 2023. All ratings are as of Monday morning.As new MLB rules help base stealers, a speedy prospect tries to run his way to the big leagues.The top team in this expected baseruns formula adjusted for opponent, the Rays, should not surprise anyone. Their performance fuels an estimate of 1.5 runs per game better than an average team. The Los Angeles Dodgers (+1.3) are second, followed by another AL East team, the Blue Jays (+1.0). The Red Sox (+0.7, seventh) and Yankees (+0.5, ninth) also rank in the top 10. (The Orioles are considered an average team by this metric and rank 16th.) Still, no other division has more than two squads among the Top 10, making the AL East clearly the strongest division in baseball.But because of baseball’s playoff format, at least one of these teams will miss the postseason, and head-to-head attrition could take a further toll. Oddsmakers aren’t convinced the eventual World Series winner will emerge from the game’s strongest division. The odds for the World Series winner to come from the AL East are between +250 (wager $100 to win $250) and +300, depending on the sportsbook. The NL East is typically the second choice at around +290 odds, while one oddsmaker, Caesars, has the NL East as a slight favorite. Two teams, the Atlanta Braves (+500 at FanDuel) and Los Angeles Dodgers (+500 at FanDuel), are also given shorter odds to win the World Series than the Rays (+650 at FanDuel).Looked at another way, those odds imply the Braves have a 17 percent chance to win the World Series while the Dodgers have a 14 percent chance. The Rays, with a 13 percent chance, are tied with the Astros.A previous version of this article incorrectly said the Oakland A's are in the American League Central. The article has been corrected. ",

      "title": "Brittney Griner’s improbable WNBA return was accompanied by a sense of triumph",
      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Brittney Griner crouched slightly at the half-court line, leaped and extended a long arm over her lean 6-foot-9 frame to easily bat the ball backward to her teammate. It was one of several movements — the tip-off to start the game — that Griner has performed hundreds of times over the past decade as the dominant center for the Phoenix Mercury.But doing it again, and this soon — in a fired-up arena with the vice president in attendance — would have been nearly impossible to picture less than a year ago, when Griner was shackled in a Russian court, being sentenced to nine years in prison.Women’s basketball just had a moment. Can the WNBA build on it?By the scoreboard alone, Griner’s return Friday to professional basketball, as Phoenix took on the Los Angeles Sparks to open the 2023 WNBA season, was a rout. The Sparks claimed a 94-71 victory, and Griner had 18 points, six rebounds and four blocks in 25 minutes. But her return cemented one of the most unlikely comeback stories in sports history — and one of the most unusual.Griner, a top star in her league, faced a dark future in a penal colony as a pawn in international relations after customs officials in Russia, where she played for a professional team during the WNBA offseason, found vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her luggage. She ultimately spent 294 days in Russian custody before being returned to the United States in December in a controversial prisoner swap for convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Friday’s season opener was her first WNBA game since Game 4 of the WNBA Finals on Oct. 17, 2021.Following the game, Griner, 32, said that her incarceration caused her to “appreciate everything a little bit more” — which included a warm welcome in an opposing team’s arena and a surprise visit to the locker room by Vice President Harris. But the sentimentality had its limits.“Not good enough,” Griner said to sum up the game. “We didn’t get the dub.”The night at times felt like a celebration accompanied by a basketball game. Before tip-off, Griner’s every movement was followed by a gaggle of video and still photographers. Fans waved cutout photos of her face, and the announcer led the arena in a chant of, “Welcome home BG!” Griner motioned to her heart as she received a standing ovation. The vice president walked on the court and waved, and several celebrities, including former Lakers all-star Pau Gasol, Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and tennis champion Billie Jean King, sat courtside.Mystics make a powerful opening statement, thump LibertyGriner stood with her teammates during the national anthem, a departure from her stance pre-incarceration, when she refused to take the court during the anthem. Her protest, which started amid national uproar over police brutality and racism in 2020, attracted conservative ire when she then required rescue from the American government. Griner explained after the game that the anthem “just means a little bit more to me now,” saying of her incarceration: “I was literally in a cage and could not stand the way I wanted to.”Griner said that she still supports her teammates who choose not to stand for the anthem, adding that making such decisions for yourself “actually makes you more American.\"Mercury Coach Vanessa Nygaard echoed that sentiment before the game, calling Friday a “day of joy\" that made her proud of her country. “We brought home this woman, this Black gay woman, from a Russian jail,” Nygaard said. \"And America did that because they valued her. ... It makes me very proud to be an American. And even though there are people for who that doesn’t make them proud, for me, I see [Griner], and I see hope.”Griner was stopped at a Moscow-area airport on Feb. 17, 2022 — a week before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — but her detention was not reported in the press for weeks afterward. For most of 2022, the American public — and Griner’s family and teammates — only received sporadic glimpses of her plight via images of her in chains or behind jail cell bars. An eight-time all-star who helped lead the Mercury to a championship in 2014, Griner sometimes seemed forgotten — which Nygaard tried to combat last year by starting every news conference with a new tally of how many days she had been incarcerated in Russia.Nygaard said that Griner’s freedom was a result of the persistence of those within the league. “When one of their sisters was in this predicament, this terrible situation, they used their voice and they amplified it,” Nygaard said. “I think it was the voices of the WNBA and the fans of the WNBA that finally got the Biden administration until they said, ‘You know what, let’s make this happen.’ ”In December, President Biden authorized the swap of Griner for Bout, a Russian national serving a 25-year sentence in American prison for arms trafficking. In remarks announcing Griner’s return, Biden said that Griner “didn’t ask for special treatment,” and that her only request was that his administration not “forget about me and the other American detainees.” Griner has since attempted to put a focus on those detainees still in Russia by posting messages to her social media encouraging “everyone that played a part in bringing me home to continue their efforts to bring all Americans home.”Griner’s saga has shed light on the compensation of the world’s best female basketball players, whose relatively paltry pay — WNBA salaries top out at just over $200,000 — has forced even the greatest of them to moonlight overseas, as Griner was when she was detained. And even with all of the pomp for Friday’s game, which was broadcast on ESPN and attracted national sports reporters, the empty upper decks of the Crypto.com Arena did not escape the attention of players and the Mercury coach. “Honestly, c’mon L.A. — we didn’t sell out the arena for B.G.?” Nygaard said. “It was great, it was loud, but how was it not a sellout?”Griner expressed hope that the media focus on her will bring new fans to the WNBA. “Hopefully everybody tuning in to see me now will see somebody else,” she said.Griner scored 11 of her points in the first half but appeared to tire in the second half, and after the game discussed improving her stamina to the point in which she could play 40 minutes if necessary. These are the sorts of problems — basketball problems — that, Griner acknowledged after the game, she sometimes thought she would never experience again.“Me personally, I look at it as the worst case scenario so I don’t get hopes up,” Griner said of her perspective while incarcerated. She then added with a wink: “I’ll elaborate on that a little bit more, just make sure you get a copy of the book.”",

      "text": "More than 18 months after placing him on administrative leave during an investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Washington Commanders rehired Doug Quon to his previous role of assistant athletic trainer.Quon, who was back on the field this month during the Commanders’ rookie minicamp, started with Washington in 2014 as an assistant athletic trainer. The team placed him on leave in the fall of 2021 when the DEA investigated Washington’s former head athletic trainer, Ryan Vermillion, for the possible disbursement of prescription painkillers. In early October of that year, DEA agents and Loudoun County law enforcement officers executed search warrants at the team’s training facility in Ashburn and Vermillion’s nearby home.The team subsequently placed Vermillion on administrative leave, and 10 months later, he agreed to a deferred prosecution for illegally obtaining controlled substances and distributing them to players during his time with the team. The NFL suspended him indefinitely from working with any club, and the Commanders fired him.The team placed Quon on leave shortly after Vermillion but without clarity as was to whether the leave was tied to the investigation. He was not charged, and according to two people with knowledge of the matter, both the NFL and the NFL Players Association approved his rehiring.Josh Harris’s Commanders deal contains ‘earnout’ payment to Daniel Snyder“Player health and safety is our top priority, and we are pleased to continue to build up our training staff with another seasoned professional with the reinstatement of Doug Quon in the role of assistant athletic trainer,” a Commanders spokesperson said in a statement. “We are happy to welcome him back.”The Commanders did not replace Vermillion or Quon during the 2021 season and instead relied on their remaining assistant athletic trainers and summer interns, as well as the temporary help of former Washington athletic trainer Bubba Tyer and former Capitals athletic trainer Greg Smith.In April 2022, the team hired Al Bellamy as head athletic trainer and later added Lindsay Gately as an assistant athletic trainer/physical therapist, making her the first full-time female member of the athletic training staff in franchise history.Commanders begin rookie minicamp with new vibes from top to bottomIn 2018, Quon was a part of a Commanders’ athletic training staff that won the Ed Block Courage Award for NFL athletic training staff of the year. He was previously an assistant athletic trainer at the University of California Irvine (2013-14) and with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2012. He also interned with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2006 and 2007 and worked with Texas Tech’s football program while earning his master’s degree in athletic training.In Washington, Quon maintains the team’s database of ImPACT concussion tests with the league in addition to assisting with the daily care and rehab of players and coordinating the team’s athletic training internship.",

      "text": "As their search for a new general manager continues, the Washington Wizards have begun making changes to Coach Wes Unseld Jr.’s staff. Alex McLean, the director of player development, and Dean Oliver, an assistant coach who specializes in analytics, will not be returning to the team, according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation.The moves indicate that Unseld will have greater power in shaping his coaching staff under the Wizards’ new regime.When he was hired in 2021, Unseld’s assistants were mostly either inherited or hired without much of his input, which is not entirely unusual, especially for a first-time head coach. Former general manager Tommy Sheppard hired Oliver to coach Scott Brooks’s staff ahead of the 2019-20 season and McLean joined the Wizards in 2017.In hiring a general manager, the Wizards should think smallerOliver is a pioneer of basketball’s analytics movement whose book, “Basketball on Paper,” introduced the importance of the “four factors” of effective field goal percentage, offensive rebound percentage, free throw rate and turnover rate, which are now so commonly known that they exist as a category on the NBA’s public-facing stats page. He had previously worked in the front offices of the Seattle SuperSonics, Denver Nuggets and Sacramento Kings.McLean, who was promoted to assistant coach in 2021, was heavily involved with player development for six years and had become especially close with franchise cornerstone Bradley Beal.Meanwhile, Wizards Owner Ted Leonsis remains in the early stages of a general manager search, according to people in rival front offices and close to the organization.Leonsis and a small group of decision-makers have had initial conversations with Milwaukee Bucks assistant general manager Milt Newton and New Orleans Pelicans General Manager Trajan Langdon, but many close to the organization describe Leonsis as still in the information-gathering stage.",

      "title": "Rookie Jake Irvin struggles, and Nats’ late rally falls short vs. Tigers ",
      "text": "When Jake Irvin walked off the mound Friday night — eyes straight ahead, a few fans clapping lightly behind the Nationals’ dugout — he left behind the worst start of his young career, long before Washington made things more interesting than expected. Irvin didn’t finish the third, with the Detroit Tigers tagging him for five hits and six runs, four of them earned.He didn’t help his case by issuing four walks. His defense didn’t help much, either.The result, an 8-6 win for the Tigers, was the Nationals’ fourth straight loss. Their offense heated late against Tigers starter Matthew Boyd, who entered with a 6.47 ERA and didn’t allow a hit until the sixth. Irvin, on the other hand, yielded a leadoff homer to Zach McKinstry and a three-run shot to Akil Baddoo in the third. His curveball, his go-to pitch, induced one whiff on seven swings. He never found a groove, putting the Nationals (18-27) in a hole they couldn’t climb out of despite three runs in the sixth and seventh.“Just making worse pitches,” Irvin said of how Friday was different from his first three starts. “It was one of those days where off-speed is not landing as often and it’s disappointing. … I wanted to set a tone.Ahead of the series opener, Manager Dave Martinez provided a list of injury updates: Center fielder Victor Robles (back spasms) is progressing slowly. Left-handed reliever Sean Doolittle (elbow surgery) continues to pitch every other day in West Palm Beach, Fla., and could do so on back-to-back days in the near future. Reliever Victor Arano (shoulder strain) had a setback during a recent bullpen session and will soon undergo another MRI exam. And starter Chad Kuhl (right foot metatarsalgia) is close to returning, whether that means a minor league rehab assignment or immediately rejoining the Nationals’ staff.Kuhl threw 65 pitches in four simulated innings at the start of the week. But asked Friday whether Kuhl will start again when healthy, Martinez was noncommittal. Kuhl posted a 9.41 ERA in 22 innings across his first five appearances. He often struggled with his command, walking 15 percent of the batters he faced (the major league average this year is 8.8). So when Irvin took his spot in the rotation May 3, it felt like a giant breath of fresh air for Washington.Irvin was more effective and could be more easily projected in the Nationals’ long-term plans. It feels logical, then, to eventually move Kuhl to the bullpen — slotting him as a third long man next to Erasmo Ramírez and Thaddeus Ward — and give Irvin an extended look, no matter what happened against the Tigers. But there is at least one counterpoint.Jake Irvin is an outlier for the Nationals. Here's why.In 2022, Irvin’s first season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, he reached 80 pitches in just five of his 24 minor league outings. Before he was promoted this spring, he topped out at 82 pitches with the Class AAA Rochester Red Wings. Since Irvin arrived in Washington, Martinez has repeatedly vowed to carefully manage his innings, hammering that he is not far removed from a major elbow procedure. That’s easier to do in Rochester than in the majors, even if there’s merit to feeding Irvin chances to build on what he has done well up here. And he has done a good bit well.“We definitely have to keep an eye on him,” Martinez said. “When he’s like that, I told [pitching coach Jim] Hickey that when he gets to 75 pitches, that’s enough.”Only 38 of those 75 pitches were strikes. Irvin started and ended the outing with a total lack of command. He issued a four-pitch walk in the first and third. He faced 18 batters in all, 11 of whom reached base via hit, walk or error, five of whom reached base in the first alone.Irvin’s first-inning error came right after McKinstry smacked his solo homer to left-center. Luis García’s error in the third, the second baseman’s first of the season, came when he threw way wide of Dominic Smith, failing to turn an inning-ending double play. Instead, Irvin threw 18 more pitches — including the change-up Baddoo launched for his homer — and didn’t make it out of the frame. And as far as defense went, Keibert Ruiz wasn’t particularly sharp for Irvin behind the plate.“From the first batter, the home run, he had the guy struck out,” Martinez said of Irvin, implying his final line was misleading because of a missed call in that matchup with McKinstry and the shoddy defense. “I mean, I don’t like … but that ball is pretty much right down the middle of the plate. He gives up a home run, and he could have gotten out of that inning with just one run. A ball back to him, and he just couldn’t make the play. And then the double play ball [to García], that cost him another three runs. That’s a difference in the ballgame.”By sharp contrast to Irvin, Boyd faced the minimum on 34 pitches through the first three innings. Hobie Harris, the first to relieve Irvin, recorded seven outs and was solid aside from Matt Vierling’s solo homer to right. Ward, who relieved Harris to start the sixth, was greeted by Riley Greene’s solo homer to right. Both blasts were relevant once the Nationals stormed back.Boyd carried a no-hit bid to the sixth, facing the minimum 15 hitters through five. Then Ruiz connected with an outside change-up that Vierling couldn’t snare while sprinting in. Two batters later, CJ Abrams hit a double to the right corner. A batter after that, Lane Thomas went deep for his sixth homer of May.The Nationals had life. Before the inning was out, Joey Meneses chased Boyd with a ground-rule double that bounced off the warning track in left. They scored three more times in the seventh, their rally capped by Ruiz’s two-run homer into Washington’s bullpen. But they were already buried deep by Irvin’s rough start, making those late sparks little more than a good sign for Saturday.",

      "title": "Bob Baffert returns to the Triple Crown stage — and a reeling sport ",
      "text": "LOS ANGELES — In 2021, horse trainer Bob Baffert faced exile from his sport and national ridicule after his Kentucky Derby-winning horse, Medina Spirit, failed a post-race drug test. It was a scandal that put drug violations and dead horses in the headlines and Baffert in the crosshairs.In the midst of it, Baffert received a call from a Palm Beach area code. It was former president Donald Trump.Trump asked him what happened with Medina Spirit, Baffert later recalled. By then, Baffert had abandoned his earlier denials that the horse was given anything that would have set off a test. So he recited to Trump his new credo — that there were mere picograms of the substance in the horse’s system, the result of a salve to treat a rash.Baffert was accustomed to dealing with local horse reporters, he told Trump. But this was his first time under fire in the national media — and on “Saturday Night Live,” which had recently lampooned the trainer. He found a sympathetic audience in the ex-president, who mused that “people can be vicious” and counseled him on how to carry on: “You know, just nothing happened. Just go on with your job and keep your head up.”Baffert, famous for sparring with regulators, probably didn’t need advice on stubborn persistence. But in the two years since that conversation, he has indeed cut a Trump-like arc. And when he enters National Treasure at Saturday’s Preakness, Baffert, having served a patchwork of suspensions stemming from the Medina Spirit violation, will make his return to the Triple Crown stage arguably more powerful and more defiant than ever — even as his sport reels from another disastrous main event.The dark side of Bob Baffert’s reignBaffert has called himself the victim of “cancel culture,” lamenting what he describes as the unfair demise of his career while working to clear bans and suspensions in Kentucky, New York and elsewhere. He has mostly failed to win in court, but the campaign of attrition appears to have fatigued his loudest critics. And despite his claims of ruin, Baffert’s business has actually thrived thanks to his loyal base: thoroughbred owners who have given him a near-monopoly over elite racing in his home state of California. Now he arrives at Pimlico to a sport in existential crisis and divided by stalled efforts to enact federal regulation of the sport.In interviews, Baffert’s lead attorney, Clark Brewster, complained of unfair courts and regulators and claimed Baffert was scapegoated by a movement within thoroughbred racing to implement federal oversight of drug violations. “A lot of people were clamoring for more enforcement of horse racing from a medication standpoint, and after the Derby when the lab found 21 picograms in urine — eureka!” said Brewster, referring to the amount of betamethasone detected in Medina Spirit’s sample.“Baffert was just iconic enough … that everyone wants to take a shot, but no one wants to write the article that says: ‘You know what? This was really overdone,’ ” Brewster added.The attorney initially raised the prospect of a reporter visiting Baffert at his barn near San Diego before the trainer headed to Maryland for the Preakness. But he later said Baffert would be unavailable for a meeting or phone interview because the trainer was “fully tuned to the details and final prep for the Pimlico horses.”When Medina Spirit tested positive for betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory, it was Baffert’s fifth positive drug test in 13 months and 30th over four decades in racing. He blamed a familiar culprit: “the science.”“That’s the only thing on this sport — you can follow the rules and still get in trouble because they don’t have the science,” Baffert later testified.After the Derby, Baffert went on a press tour blaming that science, as well as a conspiracy against him, while insisting he had never given the horse betamethasone or any other ointment. But his longtime veterinarian had documented his use of Otomax, a medication containing betamethasone, on the horse.Baffert’s shifting stories contributed to the decision to ban him, Churchill Downs Racetrack President Mike Anderson later testified. “It just seemed like it was just a lack of understanding of what his horse was being administered race day or the day before race day,” Anderson said.Baffert’s suspensions are over; he’s eligible to enter a horse at New York’s Belmont Stakes in June to round out the Triple Crown series. But his fight isn’t over, including an ongoing lawsuit against Churchill Downs and an appeal to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.In legal filings, Baffert has been dire about the effects of the punishments on his business. He claimed in affidavits that the two-year ban from the Derby, in which two of Baffert’s horses started their path to Triple Crowns, “will effectively put me out of business.”But that was certainly not so in California, where he has long wielded clout in the industry. Citizens there urged racing regulators to  levy a lengthy suspension against Baffert. “Mr. Bob Baffert and the Kentucky Derby are not on the agenda,” one commissioner said, and the industry stuck by him. That included, notably, Medina Spirit’s owner, Amr Zedan.Svrluga: The Preakness is coming, and all of horse racing holds its breathThe Saudi billionaire testified in Baffert’s defense, calling Baffert’s barn “basically the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Four Seasons, if you will, of horses.” And he was among the owners of horses in a race at Santa Anita Park near Los Angeles in February that fully displayed Baffert’s dominance: 14 of the 16 horses that were nominated and all four of the horses that ended up racing were Baffert trainees. Baffert earned roughly $9.7 million in North American races for his owners in 2022, a modest year by his standards but only $500,000 less than he earned in 2019, the last pre-pandemic year before the scandal.While Baffert dominated his competition in California, his lawyers attempted to refashion his legacy in court. In court filings, his attorneys tallied only “fully adjudicated medication positives” and only those since 2005 — of which by their count there were nine, not 30. They reduced even more drastically the death toll attributed to him. The Washington Post found in 2021 that 74 horses had died in Baffert’s care in California and that his horses have the highest rate of deaths per start among top trainers in the state. In court filings, however, Baffert’s team cited an obscure database tracking only some deaths in recent years and operated by a Kentucky nonprofit to peg the Baffert death toll at five.Baffert’s actual toll has increased by at least three since his last Derby, records show. Medina Spirit died of a heart attack in December 2021. Then, last July, a 2-year-old horse called Rapacious was euthanized after falling on its back during a workout. And in January, Alsalam, a 3-year-old owned by Zedan, was euthanized following a workout. Veterinary notes describing Alsalam’s death read: “Went wrong pulled up, vanned off.”No necropsy was performed. Amanda Drummond, an official at the California Horse Racing Board, said that was because Alsalam died at an equine hospital. The board is “presently advancing a regulation” that would require necropsies in those cases, Drummond said.Brewster called The Post’s count “false” and said it was unfair to monitor all deaths in Baffert’s care. In many cases, he said, “it doesn’t have anything to do with training — it has to do with natural events that occur with all animals that can cause an injury or death.”Shortly before he left office, Trump signed an act resulting in the creation of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, a regulatory body to oversee drug rules in the sport.But its anti-doping efforts have stalled, primarily because of legal challenges by the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, an industry group that includes racehorse owners and trainers. HISA is now slated to go into effect Monday, two days after the Preakness.HISA CEO Lisa Lazarus said in an interview Thursday that she is “very confident” the authority will not be delayed further by last-minute legal efforts. Lazarus said HISA will start every trainer with a clean slate in terms of tracking — and punishing — drug violations.“I would say to any trainer who has proclaimed their innocence and feels like they were wrongly treated by the system … now’s an opportunity to show that you’re doing things the right way,” Lazarus said.Arthur Hancock III, a Kentucky breeder, is among those horsemen who helped push for the bill. In the wake of the deaths at the Derby, he expressed pessimism about whether the sport can be finally cleaned up. Churchill Downs suspended a trainer of two of the horses indefinitely and in a statement said the deaths, though “anomalies,” were “unacceptable.”Hancock said the opinion among some horsemen is that “they’re cheating more than ever now” amid a vacuum of enforcement. “Status quo, business as usual — I mean, that’s what it looks like to me,” Hancock said.Monty Roberts, a retired horse trainer who has sparred with Baffert for years, expressed hope that the sport will be run more strictly under the new authority. In that case, he said, he welcomed Baffert’s return.“I would love it if he could just compete with everybody on a clean basis,” Roberts said. “Because then you would see how good he is. The way it is now, he wins a race and you say, ‘Oh, I wonder what that horse is on.’ ”",

      "title": "NHL’s Coyotes may be forced out of Arizona after voters reject arena plan",
      "text": "The future of professional hockey in the Phoenix area is in doubt after voters Tuesday rejected three ballot measures that would have allowed the construction of a new stadium for the NHL’s Coyotes in Tempe, Ariz.The ballot questions all revolved around the construction of a $2.1 billion entertainment district on a city-owned, 46-acre tract of land in Tempe, about two miles east of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The project would have included a 16,000-seat arena for the Coyotes, two hotels, a theater and nearly 2,000 residential units, and at least $1.9 billion of the costs would have been privately funded.The vote on the proposal, by Tempe residents, was done almost entirely by mail and reportedly featured high turnout. As of Wednesday morning, two of the ballot measures were losing by a margin of 56 percent to 46 percent, and the third trailed 57 percent to 43 percent. Maricopa County election officials said there weren’t enough same-day ballots left to count that would overcome those margins.“The NHL is terribly disappointed by the results of the public referenda regarding the Coyotes’ arena project in Tempe,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We are going to review with the Coyotes what the options might be going forward.”Inside the NBA draft lottery room: Heartbreak for the WizardsThe opposition to the plan was twofold. Some residents decried the portion of the deal that precluded the proposed arena from paying property taxes over the next 30 years, particularly because the overall plan did not include any affordable housing. The city of Phoenix also had filed a lawsuit against Tempe, claiming the proposal breached a 1994 agreement between the two cities that prohibited housing from being built within the airport’s high-noise flight path.Tempe 1st, a group that opposed the proposal, called the result “a victory by Tempe for Tempe. This win goes to show that Tempe residents love our community, we know what’s best for it and we must be part of every conversation when it comes to our land, our tax dollars, and what we value as our city grows.”The election defeat leaves the Coyotes without a plan for a viable NHL-size arena in the Phoenix area. They played their home games this past season at Mullett Arena, a 5,000-seat venue on the campus of Arizona State University that is far smaller than any other North American professional hockey arena. And while the Coyotes have two more years on their agreement with the school — NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told ESPN on Wednesday that he expected the team to play there next season — there is speculation that the Coyotes could be forced to relocate after the deal runs out. Cities such as Houston, Atlanta, Kansas City, Mo., Salt Lake City and Quebec City have been cited as possible destinations.The Coyotes have had a fraught history since relocating from Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1996. They first played their home games in Phoenix at what was then called America West Arena, the home of the NBA’s Suns, where a rink had to be shoehorned into a venue that was not built with ice hockey in mind. As a result, some seats hung over one end of the ice, and fans sitting in those sections could not see the goal directly below. The poor views, which cut down on the number of tickets the team could sell, and an unfavorable lease caused the team to move to a newly built arena owned by the suburban city of Glendale in 2003.The move did not change the team’s sagging financial fortunes, and in 2009 the franchise declared bankruptcy and was purchased by the NHL. Since then, the franchise has cycled through ownership groups and has been a frequent subject of relocation rumors, mainly because of its arena situation. In August 2021, the city of Glendale — which had propped up the team with millions of dollars of public money and at one time threatened to lock the team out of the arena because of missed tax payments — announced it would not renew its lease agreement with the Coyotes, forcing their move to the smaller venue on Arizona State’s campus.The Coyotes have only one playoff appearance over the past 11 seasons and last won a postseason series during their run to the 2012 Western Conference finals. As a result, attendance has suffered: In 2021-22, their last season at the Glendale arena, Arizona averaged only 11,601 fans, which ranked 30th out of 32 NHL teams and was lower than some Canadian teams whose attendance was limited by pandemic restrictions.",

      "title": "Minor league baseball team to bid Dan Snyder good riddance with Josh Harris promotion",
      "text": "The Bowie Baysox will toast the impending sale of their Prince George’s County neighbors to a group of investors led by Josh Harris with a Washington Commanders ownership change celebration Thursday during their game against the Altoona Curve.As part of the festivities, all fans wearing Washington football team gear may purchase box seats for half-price ($10), while supplies last. In addition, all fans with the first or last name Josh or Harris and anyone wearing a Magic Johnson jersey will receive a free general admission ticket. Johnson, the Los Angeles Lakers Hall of Famer, is a partner in Harris’s group, which on Friday completed a signed agreement to purchase the Commanders from Daniel Snyder — much to the delight of the team’s downtrodden fan base.Baysox General Manager Brian Shallcross said his front office team had been discussing for several weeks ways to celebrate the sale, which still must be approved by the NFL finance committee and ratified by the league’s franchise owners.“We didn’t want to do anything until that type of agreement was in place,” Shallcross said in a phone interview. “We didn’t want to jump the gun.”Shallcross, the GM of the Baltimore Orioles’ Class AA affiliate since 2004, said his team’s original idea was to throw a Snyder retirement party.“Ultimately we decided we just didn’t want to acknowledge Dan that much,” he said of the Commanders’ reviled owner, who bought the team in 1999. “We wanted the promotion to be positive and forward-looking. … It’s hard to find somebody that has positive things to say about the organization and the ownership, so we just thought it was the right time for a celebration.”Rating every game on the Commanders' 2023 scheduleThe Baysox play their home games at Prince George’s Stadium, which is roughly 10 miles from FedEx Field.“The Commanders are our next-door neighbor, and I think minor league baseball is about community, first and foremost,” Shallcross said. “Minor league baseball has a long history of not taking itself too seriously.”(For one game in 2016, the Baysox changed the pronunciation of their name from Boo-ee to Boh-ee in honor of rock musician David Bowie, who died earlier that year. The previous season, they held a back hair appreciation night.)IT'S OVER! Celebrate the long-awaited ownership change of the Washington Commanders with us on Thursday, May 18!Anyone named Josh or Harris receives a free GA ticket. Those in team gear will get discounts with a chance to throw first pitch!More info: https://t.co/mmMFsWnA8B pic.twitter.com/iMEbk5dWvBIn addition to the ticket promotions for Thursday’s game, a fan named Josh, a fan named Harris and a fan wearing a Magic Johnson jersey will throw ceremonial first pitches. Between innings, the Baysox will take a tongue-in-cheek look back at the Commanders’ past 24 years, and Shallcross suggested Snyder’s bizarre “Happy Thanksgiving” greeting at the January 2020 news conference to introduce Ron Rivera as coach might be featured. Cake will be served to bolster the party atmosphere.Shallcross grew up a Philadelphia Eagles fan, but now he cheers for the Buffalo Bills because they’re coached by his former roommate at William & Mary, Sean McDermott. Still, he sympathizes with Commanders supporters. In 2012, the Baysox appealed to some of those fans by announcing that Snyder’s former right-hand man, Vinny Cerrato, would appear in a dunk tank at the team’s annual football kickoff celebration to raise money for charity. Cerrato ultimately backed out.“We talked about having a dunk tank with someone named Dan, and we just thought it was a step too far,” Shallcross said of the various ideas his team considered for this week’s celebration. “There’s so much toxic that you could dive into, but ultimately we wanted to make it more of a celebration for the Commanders fans who have been waiting for this day. … We’re in the business of making people laugh and smile, and hopefully this Thursday people will come laugh and smile.”",

      "title": "Corey Dickerson’s welcome-back HR not enough for Nats in loss to Marlins",
      "text": "MIAMI — Corey Dickerson had waited over a month to return to the Washington Nationals’ lineup. When he finally stepped to the plate, he didn’t waste any time.The 33-year-old slugger squared up the second pitch he saw from Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera in the second inning and launched it into the second deck at LoanDepot Park for a two-run homer. The blast came in his first at-bat since April 1, when he strained his calf and subsequently went on the injured list the following day.Dickerson finished 2 for 4 with a pair of runs scored, providing much of the offense for the Nationals in a 4-3 loss.“It felt like Opening Day for me,” Dickerson said. “To get the first hit, first homer out of the way was pretty cool. But it all goes to the training staff who did such a good job getting me back. They really cared and put in the effort and time and I’m pretty appreciative to them.”Josiah Gray made changes in the offseason. So far, that’s helping.Nationals Manager Dave Martinez wanted to bring in a left-handed outfielder last offseason who could provide pop in the middle of the order. The Nationals eventually signed Dickerson to a one-year, $2.25 million deal in January.But Dickerson’s hasty trip to the IL left a void in the order. Washington recalled Stone Garrett, leaving Martinez with four right-handed hitters and limited platoon options. Meanwhile, Dickerson traveled with the team while rehabbing, and as the Nationals struggled to hit for power, his absence somehow felt more pronounced.Joey Meneses — the team’s primary designated hitter — has two home runs. Jeimer Candelario and Dominic Smith have four and one respectively. As a team, Washington entered Wednesday 29th in the majors in homers (27) and 28th in slugging (.367). So Dickerson’s blast was a welcome sight.“It was awesome,” Martinez said of the homer. “He’s waited a long time to get back in the lineup. It’s good to see that he’s healthy and he’s going to help us.”Dickerson gave an early lead to MacKenzie Gore, who was unable to hold it. Gore was more efficient against the Marlins compared with his previous outing, throwing 60 of 93 pitches for strikes. He got seven whiffs on 10 swings against his curveball.Gore allowed a run in the second inning on a sacrifice fly by Yuli Gurriel, then became the latest Nationals pitcher victimized by Jorge Soler, who blasted a two-run homer a night after lifting the Marlins to a walk-off win Tuesday with a two-run shot off Hunter Harvey. Gore wanted to pitch inside, but he missed his location.“That’s the one guy that we can’t let beat us going in,” Gore said about Soler. “And I threw a pitch right down the middle. So it’s frustrating for that reason, but the stuff was fine.”Gore’s outing was over after he allowed an RBI double to Bryan De La Cruz in the sixth inning to give Miami a 4-2 lead. His line included seven strikeouts and two walks.Dickerson sparked a rally when he singled to open the seventh and Ildemaro Vargas followed with the same; both advanced 90 feet on a throwing error by Jon Berti. Alex Call drove in Dickerson with a groundout, but CJ Abrams and Lane Thomas struck out swinging, leaving Vargas at second.Dickerson had one more chance to play hero with the Nationals trailing by one run and Candelario on first in the ninth. But he hit into a fielder’s choice before Vargas bounced into a game-ending double play.The Nationals’ issues Wednesday were easy to trace — they struck out nine times and went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position. And outside of Dickerson’s homer, they only had one extra-base hit.“We were really close,” Dickerson said. “You’re always disappointed when you get out in the last outing. … As a player, we have short memories. … You compete and you hate when you lose. So you look forward to the next time.”The Nationals placed Meneses on paternity leave before Wednesday’s game and recalled infielder Jake Alu from Class AAA Rochester. Meneses’s fiancee gave birth to their son, Joseph, according to the player’s Instagram. Meneses is eligible to return to the active roster Saturday.Alu, 26, arrived in time for first pitch. He had been demoted Monday afternoon when Dickerson returned from the injured list. Alu made his major league debut May 9 and picked up his first hit against the Mets on Friday.Aníbal Sánchez threw out the ceremonial first pitch at LoanDepot Park on Wednesday after announcing his retirement a day earlier. Sánchez, 39, pitched 16 years in the majors and spent time with the Marlins, Detroit Tigers and Atlanta Braves before his final stop with the Nationals.Sánchez pitched his final three seasons in Washington, taking a year off in 2021 before returning in 2022. His finest performance for Washington came when he tossed 7⅔ no-hit innings in Game 1 of the 2019 NLCS against the Cardinals en route to a World Series title. Sánchez said he will spend more time with family in retirement, though he didn’t rule out eventually coaching.",

      "title": "Josiah Gray made changes in the offseason. So far, that’s helping.",
      "text": "MIAMI — Josiah Gray entered this season with a handful of goals. One was to pitch deeper into games. Last season, he only got into the seventh inning twice in 28 tries.That’s already going well. Gray has pitched through seven innings in back-to-back starts this season, including Tuesday night against the Miami Marlins. He finished with 104 pitches in that game, and even when he wasn’t as demonstrated that he has four pitches he can trust even when he isn’t as sharp.“It gives me that belief in myself that, when my stuff isn’t the best [and] I’m having to grind through pitch usage when my slider wasn’t where I wanted it to be today, I can still use my other pitches to get groundouts, get flyouts, get pop-ups,” said Gray, who noted he’s done a much better job of staying calm and trusting himself in tight situations. “This outing [showed] what future success can look like if I don’t have my swing-and-miss stuff that day.”Hunter Harvey can’t seal deal and the Marlins walk off the NationalsLast season, Gray walked a National League-leading 66 batters and allowed an MLB-high 38 home runs. Those mistakes led to longer innings, which resulted in high pitch counts. His walks per nine innings rate is down slightly from last season (4.0 to 3.8), but he’s cut down his home runs per nine innings from 2.3 to 0.9.This year, Gray is getting groundballs in 45.5 percent of his at-bats, compared with 34 percent last year. He’s sacrificed high strikeout numbers for early outs this season, allowing him to hang around longer in games.“I think I’m starting to really understand about, if I have a runner on first and second, two outs, one out, how do I utilize my arsenal to get a groundball to get a double play instead of relying so much on the strikeout?” Gray said last month about efficiency. “To where I might have to throw this guy seven pitches on the black of the zone when I can throw him three pitches, get the ground out and we’re back in the dugout. So just learning about myself as a pitcher and learning more about the process. Each day is a journey, but I’m really embracing it this year.”Gray has also added a cutter, something he developed this offseason after he realized that just throwing a four-seam fastball wouldn’t cut it. Last season, opponents had a .305 batting average and .742 slugging percentage off Gray’s fastball. Twenty-four of those 38 homers came off the pitch.“I was just sort of ticked off at me going out there, throwing 95-plus, and now the hitters are seeing it like it’s a BP fastball,” Gray said last month. “So it was kind of like, ‘Okay, how can I switch up looks somewhat?’ ”Nationals pitching coach Jim Hickey said Gray’s fastball ran well off the plate to his arm side. Those misses made him vulnerable to home runs and walks last year, especially against lefties. But adding a cutter to the arsenal gives him a pitch that runs in on the hands of lefties. Hickey pointed to other pitchers who added the cutter for the same reason. Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen was an all-star in 2018, the first season he started throwing it. Gerrit Cole, Jameson Taillon and Brusdar Graterol have also added cutters in recent years.But Hickey said Gray is simply executing pitches better this year, too. His direction to the plate — a point of emphasis this offseason — is pretty close to the same as last year, Hickey said. The difference: His back side is allowing him to throw on more of a downward plane. That’s leading to better pitches.“You’re not seeing these noncompetitive-type misses,” Hickey said. “For the most part, everything that he’s throwing is a decision-making pitch to a hitter. At least that’s what I call it. It’s not one of those where as soon as it leaves your hand, it’s like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’ I mean, there’s been a couple of those, but in the past, there was a number of them per game and he’s really, really shrunk that number down.”Gray allowed three home runs in his first game, a deflating start to the year. But he’s only allowed two home runs since. He’s seemed to get stronger as games have gone on. And though he’s been critical of his past few starts, he’s avoided any major damage.That’s built some trust with Manager Dave Martinez. And Tuesday, Gray came through again and kept the Nationals in the game. A year ago, that might not have happened.“I think he’s learned in these high-leverage situations to control the heartbeat and get through it,” Martinez said. “Like I said, today was a big moment for him. He got through it again.”",

      "title": "Perspective | Nikola Jokic is now, Victor Wembanyama is next and the NBA is worldwide",
      "text": "The night began with San Antonio Spurs Chairman Peter Holt screaming in delight over winning the lottery for French phenom Victor Wembanyama and ended with Serbian superstar Nikola Jokic taking shots that seemed to exit the atmosphere before splashing down into the net. It was a banner, global doubleheader for the NBA, not merely an indicator of the sport’s growth worldwide but a show of utter dominance.Although a wealth of American talent sustains the NBA, the most compelling and coveted young players in the game now were introduced to basketball abroad. If a streak of five straight foreign-born NBA MVPs wasn’t persuasive enough, and if four international stars making the all-NBA first team this season didn’t do the trick, then how about seeing a middle-aged man celebrating the right to draft Wembanyama by acting like he just scored Taylor Swift tickets?“I … I … I might faint,” Holt said on ESPN on Tuesday night.Others would rather roll their eyes. The envy isn’t limited to San Antonio, the forever home of David Robinson and Tim Duncan, landing the No. 1 pick during another draft blessed with a supreme big man prospect. There’s also a faction, which plenty of NBA players will lead on the sly, destined to tire quickly of the Victor hype and relegate him to the same reputation purgatory that Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have experienced.Inside the NBA draft lottery room: Heartbreak for the WizardsIn general, NBA discourse is the Hater’s Ball of sports. Yet for as half-witted and spiteful as the public can be, the competitors are also as catty as they come. The adoration international players receive is a particular sore spot.On one hand, it’s understandable because the league’s players, who are predominantly African American, have long endured prejudicial criticism. Sometimes, the appreciation of “refreshing” global talent can sound like veiled anti-Black sentiments. Still, game is supposed to recognize game. But as fresh and groundbreaking talent emerges around the world, a zero-sum mentality creates a battle for influence.Some of the hesitance to anoint beloved players prematurely is customary pro sports behavior. But the whispers of ridicule about some international stars gets ridiculous at times. Behind the obligatory compliments, Antetokounmpo was dismissed by his peers before he dominated the 2021 NBA Finals and led the Milwaukee Bucks to a championship. Even now, as he makes his corny dad jokes and pontificates about the absence of failure, he doesn’t command the respect in every locker room of a two-time MVP who has been the league’s most dominant player over the past five seasons.Jokic, another two-time MVP, has encountered disrespect as he continues to rise in stature. At the height of it, Kendrick Perkins, a former player turned ESPN analyst, accused him of padding stats. Perkins was trying to explain away Joker’s all-around effectiveness to boost the MVP candidacy of Joel Embiid, the eventual winner. Jokic laughed it off. But to his peers, Jokic will be more darling than game changer until his retro-modern game results in more than carrying the Denver Nuggets through hardship.French center Rudy Gobert, who has won three defensive player of the year awards, is often challenged and derided as soft. When players griped on social media about the all-NBA voting, one unstated source of their frustration was clear: Canadian guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who averaged 31.4 points this season.There’s an incredulous vibe right now. The celebration of enhanced inclusivity always comes with some fear of replacement. The American basketball player is still the standard. But the most recognizable faces of the NBA game are certain to look different. If you’re looking for an elite combination of size and skill, the greatest of those prodigies are sprouting elsewhere. From Slovenian guard Luka Doncic functioning as a supersized floor general to Jokic controlling the game as a 280-pound point center, the world isn’t catching up. The world has arrived, complete with a Greek Freak and a Cameroonian center who plays like a 21st-century Hakeem Olajuwon.Over the past three decades, foreign-born players have diversified the game, expanded our basketball palate — and saved the big man from extinction. Quality bigs, though rare now, didn’t disappear. They just wandered overseas and redefined the position.And here comes Wembanyama, a 7-foot-4 evolutionary athlete who plays defense like a classic center, dribbles and shoots as well as players a foot shorter and possesses a charisma that could help the NBA captivate the world in new ways.A prospect hasn’t carried so much justified hype since LeBron James was drafted out of high school in 2003. Some consider Wembanyama the greatest phenom in basketball history, which is unquantifiable and silly. But for those who have lived through a lot of next big things, it doesn’t matter where Wembanyama ranks among them. What’s important is that he looks to be one of them.Spurs win NBA draft lottery and right to select Victor WembanyamaAnd what’s remarkable is that we have been able to see him coming, all the way from Paris, the big basketball world within reach of a teenager with an 8-foot wingspan. As the NBA has grown as a global brand, no player has come to America with so much name recognition and praise. If he reaches his potential, Wembanyama will reconceive a sport eager for more big men who can play the fluid, positionless style that now dominates the game.First, he must prove himself. The players can’t wait to test him. If he stays healthy, Wembanyama has reason to be encouraged his game will translate. He enters the NBA in the same summer that international legends Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker will be enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame. His future coach, Gregg Popovich, is also in the class of 2023.And as the NBA playoffs near a conclusion, ol’ stat-padding Jokic is on top of his game. In the Nuggets’ Game 1 victory over the Los Angeles in the Western Conference finals, Jokic scored 34 points, grabbed 21 rebounds and dished 14 assists. He owned a game in which Anthony Davis finished with 40 points and James fell one assist shy of his own triple-double.If the Nuggets simply needed Jokic to score, his points alone would have been impressive. If they simply needed him to rebound, his Dennis Rodman-like board work would have warranted raves. If they simply needed a table-setting playmaker, his dimes would have been worthy of headlines. But he did it all at once, directing an offense that shot 55 percent and made 15 three-pointers and owning the paint as the Nuggets outrebounded the Lakers by 17.To add icing, Jokic hit a casual 28-foot stepback jumper with Davis all over him, the highlight of a night in which he destroyed one of the league’s most potent defensive players.JOKIC 3️⃣ OVER AD TO END THE THIRD‼️ pic.twitter.com/yUEgHUerdzAfter the shot fell through, Davis looked over his shoulder at Jokic and grinned. With both palms up, Jokic shrugged.“There’s nothing else I could have done,” said Davis, who watched Jokic make 10 of 13 shots when he was guarding the former MVP.There was no NBA culture war to fight on this night. Jokic was a force, not embellished great hope. And the excitement over Wembanyama’s arrival is already causing lightheadedness. The game keeps growing, in every direction.",

      "title": "She had lived a life of adventure. Then came the ultimate sailing race.",
      "text": "Crimson flares dyed the evening sky a blazing red as Kirsten Neuschafer guided her sailboat into the French port of Les Sables-d’Olonne on April 27. Eight months earlier, she had left this harbor as the lone woman in a 16-entrant, around-the-world race in which solo competitors were required to use 54-year-old technology and prohibited from making stops.During 235 days at sea, Neuschafer had only a vague knowledge of her place in the standings of the Golden Globe Race. When told by event organizers that she had won, all she could do was stare in surprise and blurt, “Really?”Since leaving her family farm outside Pretoria, South Africa, as a teenager, Neuschafer, 41, has led a life of endless adventure: hitchhiking on ships to the Arctic, training huskies in the icy wilderness, bicycling across Africa and leading sailing expeditions to the bottom of the globe. But she had never done anything quite like the Golden Globe Race. Very few have.This was only the second Golden Globe Race since it was revived in 2018 as a replica of the famous 1968 venture by the same name during which nine men attempted to circle the planet in sailboats. (Only one completed the circuit, and another was declared dead by suicide.) It’s less a competition and more a fight to keep mind and boat intact while sailing with only instruments and communication devices available in 1968.Following the course that headed south after leaving France, before heading east to sail past the southern tip of Africa and continuing south of Australia and South America and finally turning back north to return, competitors paused at just four designated spots to check in with race officials in nearby boats. Even then, the sailors aren’t allowed to leave their boats and can’t take on supplies, relying instead on whatever they packed before the trip. Aside from satellite phones used for emergencies, they are essentially on their own.“These people are f------ crazy,” Neuschafer’s friend Alicia Biggart said.When Neuschafer first heard about the Golden Globe Race in 2019, her first thought was “that it seems kind of cool.” But that was before she set off last Sept. 4 in a 36-foot boat she helped rebuild.Her friends worried she would return feral with wild eyes and ragged hair. Instead, she glowed in her fiery welcome at the finish line tooting a small plastic vuvuzela and seemed very much like a woman at peace.“It was actually nine out of 10 times quite enjoyable,” she said by phone from Les Sables-d’Olonne, where she has been recovering from the trip. “I really enjoyed the last few months being one with the ocean.”Neuschafer’s friends have long been amazed by her ability to spend weeks alone on her many excursions and then return as happy as when she left. They love her curiosity. They are amazed at her fluency in English, Afrikaans, German and French and deep understanding of several more languages, including some they had never heard of. Mostly, though, they are dazzled by her stories of adventure, most of which have to be solicited because she never brings them up herself.Such as how, at 19, while on a visit to Finland, she was struck by a desire to see the Arctic and went around the local port offering to peel potatoes in exchange for a ride north.Or how she stayed for two years in northern Finland, working as a wilderness guide, carrying a gun in case a polar bear pushed its way into her tent.Or how, at 22, while traveling in Portugal, she decided to bicycle home to South Africa, crossing from Spain to Morocco by ferry and cycling down back roads with little more than a small tent, a water purifier, a portable stove and a pocket knife.Or how people in the remote villages along the way rushed to see her, intrigued, she said, “by the White woman bicycling across Africa.” Or how in one particularly hidden part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, she contracted malaria and slept for three weeks in a hut with a family whose father, on the day she left, called her “my White daughter.”Or how she spent the next several years working for a sailboat charter company, leading film crews on wildlife excursions around South Georgia Island and Antarctica.“She’s just very uplifting,” said Erin Ranney, a photographer and videographer who spent a month with Neuschafer on one of those trips. “She would walk me through so many things and help me to realize I could do them.”Neuschafer first heard of the Golden Globe Race in 2019, when she took one of the charter company’s boats to Maine for repairs. She initially hesitated about entering. She didn’t own a boat, and the cost of buying and preparing one for such an ordeal would be more than $300,000. She wasn’t independently wealthy like many of the Golden Globe Race entrants who sent their boats to expensive repair yards to be refitted.It took urging from a group of friends in Maine, including Biggart, who offered to help her find sponsors and donors before Neuschafer finally signed up. She spent weeks looking for the right boat, falling in love with a Cape George Cutter 36 in Newfoundland named Minnehaha, after the wife of the Native American adventurer Hiawatha in the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, “The Song of Hiawatha.”The name seemed to fit. She bought Minnehaha in late 2020 and hoped to sail somewhere warm to begin the restoration when winter weather forced her to stop on the north shore of Prince Edward Island in January 2021. Trapped there as the harbor froze over, her friend network put her in touch with Eddie Arsenault, a local boat builder, who pulled Minnehaha from the water and took her by lobster boat trailer to a repair garage on his property.Neuschafer told Arsenault about her around-the-world race. He told her it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and said he would help her refurbish Minnehaha.“She had a long list of things to do,” Arsenault said. “But soon it doubled and tripled.”They installed new deck flooring and strengthened the mast, creating contingencies in case something broke during the race. They remade cabinets to gain extra storage space and replaced nearly every bolt and hook.“Each time we did one thing, it was like opening a can of worms,” Arsenault said.The work took almost all of 2021, and at times Neuschafer felt deflated because there was so much to do. But years sailing the rough southern seas had shown her the advantages of having a strong, heavy boat as opposed to the lighter, faster boats of her competitors. She saved space for 100 jars of premade meals donated by French chef Jean-Louis LeClerc and for nearly 100 books.And when she and Arsenault finished, she knew every piece of her redone boat in detail. When something broke on Minnehaha, she would know how to fix it.It would be months into the race before Neuschafer realized how much those efforts had paid off. One by one, the other skippers gave up, their boats damaged. Two quit with broken self-steering systems; one left with rigging problems; another broke his bowsprit. Alone, with scant contact and few indications from the race directors, Neuschafer sailed along, oblivious to the others’ troubles.“I was enjoying my solitude,” she said.She fell into what she called her “routine,” rising early to watch the sunrise and set her direction with the position of the morning sun. She walked the boat looking for signs of scuffing, she adjusted her sails, she napped in the afternoons and kept watch for cargo ships in the evenings.She never felt alone. She knew her friends were tracking her progress on the race’s website. That gave her peace.Mostly, though, she read.She read historical novels written in Afrikaans by Dalene Matthee. She read “The Bookseller of Kabul” in English and a Spanish translation of “The Clan of the Cave Bear.” Wanting to learn Xhosa, a language spoken primarily along South Africa’s southern and east coasts, she brought Xhosa lesson books and a Xhosa dictionary.When a day seemed particularly bleak, she found calm in reading chapters from “The Long Way,” a book written by Bernard Moitessier, a contestant in the original 1968 Golden Globe Race who took to yoga as a means of coping with the trip’s loneliness.Neuschafer also read, in Finnish, a book written by another competitor, 65-year-old Tapio Lehtinen, about his odyssey in the 2018 Golden Globe race. That familiarity made it even more shocking when, three months into the race, a series of alerts came across her satellite phone saying Lehtinen’s boat had sunk and he was floating on a life raft in the middle of the Indian Ocean.Contacting race organizers, Neuschafer learned she was the closest entrant to Lehtinen. Temporarily abandoning the race, she unsealed her phone, activated the GPS and turned on Minnehaha’s engines, sailing all night without sleep to reach him.“You have no idea how difficult it is to find a life raft in the ocean,” she said.Fortunately, Lehtinen spotted Minnehaha’s sails. Once Neuschafer helped him on board, they drank glasses of rum and toasted his survival. Soon after, Lehtinen was transferred to a cargo ship, which also had rerouted in search of him, and Neuschafer resumed her journey.As 2022 turned to 2023, Minnehaha held strong. Competitors kept dropping out until she was one of just three remaining. As she neared the end, she hit windless doldrums near the equator and sat for almost two weeks. She was distraught, certain the others had passed her. To cope, she took long swims away from Minnehaha until the boat was a speck in the distance, before turning back.When the winds finally picked up, she sailed on for France, determined at least to finish. That’s when she received the surprising news that she had won.The first few days after race’s end in Les Sables d’Olonne were like one long party. So many of the people she had come to know from South Africa and Maine and Prince Edward Island and everywhere else had gathered to see her. At first, she was overjoyed, but after a week, she fell sick with the coronavirus. Eight months alone at sea had diminished her immunity.As she recovered, she contemplated her trip and was struck by a sense of emptiness.“It’s funny, what a strange feel time gets when you do something like this,” she said. “It’s been an all-consuming project since 2019 to getting across the finish line. I don’t think it’s hit me yet that it’s all over.”She wants to go home to South Africa. She wants to see her father, who has been ill. She wants, too, to work on Minnehaha, replacing all the pieces that had worn during the journey. Then, she will part with the boat that became her friend on the empty ocean. She will not do the Golden Globe Race again. The second time would never be the same.“I guess I will have to sell her,” Neuschaefer said of Minnehaha, a tinge of sadness in her voice. “That was the thing all along, wasn’t it? Once you have the privilege of owning her, it’s time to pass her along to someone else.”She knows the boat, once repaired, will be worth more than the $65,000 she paid for it, especially with the prestige that will come with having been the winning vessel of the Golden Globe Race.“She had the ultimate sea trial!” Neuschafer said, with the laugh of one of the few people on the planet who could understand.",

      "title": "Football bonded them. Its violence tore them apart.",
      "text": "Deep Reads features The Washington Post’s best immersive reporting and narrative writing.About a year ago, a bunch of old college roommates met up at a tavern in rural Nebraska. Most of them had played football at Harvard in the late 1990s. Now they were in their mid-40s, their broad shoulders rounded, their hairlines giving way to the beach erosion of time. But the same nonsense made them laugh: the teammate from California who wet the bed, the kid whose family ran a traveling carnival, the time a traffic cone mysteriously appeared in their living room after a night of drinking.Old roommates keep certain memories locked away, untouched until they’re together again. If football teams are sports’ biggest tribe and produce unbreakable bonds, the friendships grow that much tighter when they involve sharing a refrigerator and toilet.The carnival kid is Harvard’s defensive coordinator now. Another ex-roommate has written jokes for Jimmy Kimmel. One was a federal air marshal until he couldn’t stand the boredom. And over there, near the Herbie Husker mural, was the nation’s leading voice on sports-related brain trauma, the man CNN called when Tua Tagovailoa suited up after a concussion last season and Newsweek interviewed after Aaron Hernandez killed himself in prison.On this night in Nebraska, the friends broke the seal. Stories and beer flowed. Mostly they reminisced about the roommate they had come to bury. He had been their team captain, the best of an illustrious collection of Harvard men, an almost comic assemblage of genes and charm. He had been the soft-spoken roommate. The clean(ish) one. They tried to square it with what he had become. How had he kept it all secret, even from them?When the bartender went to fetch another case, someone pointed out the paradox of meeting at a bar to honor a man who had drunk himself to death. Some social rituals just are, and remaining a member of the tribe means never challenging its code.“It’s just what we do,” says one of the old teammates, Brian Daigle. “At tailgates, at a wedding or party or, in this case, for a funeral.”The bartender returned and passed out fresh cans. A little before closing time, Daigle posed a question to the group: If you had known then what you know now about football, the game that had brought them all together, would you play? Knowing it could be you in the next casket, would you still?Chris Nowinski was driving with his family in Florida recently, about a year after his old roommate’s funeral, when his phone rang. The father of an Olympic ice dancer was calling to discuss the ongoing symptoms of his daughter’s concussion. Then another call: A kid who had played seven years of football needed a psychiatrist. Another: the parents of a Division I women’s basketball player whose coach insisted on playing her despite lingering concussion symptoms.“Almost every car ride we take, we get these calls,” says Nowinski’s wife, Nicole. “A child, a wife, a mother, asking Chris, ‘Please help.’ He has this in his head 24-7.”Nowinski played defensive tackle for the Crimson and still counts his old roommates as his closest friends. He lives in South Florida with Nicole and their daughter and son, 4 and 2, but he will never stop caring about what the Harvard guys think — and where he fits into a decades-old hierarchy. Several of the friends are lawyers or executives or venture capitalists, but the Crimson football team produced only one 6-foot-5 canary in the sports coal mine, constantly chirping about the dangers of his old sport. Nowinski is why most American sports fans have even heard of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and his personality and bona fides are a major reason the NFL grudgingly began inching its concussion protocols beyond the dark ages. When Boston University’s CTE Center wants grieving relatives to donate a former athlete’s brain, it’s often Nowinski who suggests they make the phone call.CTE can be confirmed only posthumously, so Nowinski’s primary objective is connecting those who suspect they have the disease with the vast network of resources maintained by the Concussion Legacy Foundation, the advocacy group he founded in 2007 alongside neurosurgeon Robert Cantu. Some need an appointment with a neurologist; others require addiction specialists and support groups. Many are just looking for someone who understands.“You can’t always fix it,” Nowinski says. “But if I’m able to talk to them, there’s almost always a happy ending.”If his phone stops ringing long enough, sometimes Nowinski calls the old Harvard guys to check in. Scott Larkee in Cambridge, Mass.; Isaiah Kacyvenski in Boston; Daigle in North Carolina. They catch up, talk about the Crimson’s chances next season, do what you do for a taste of that fleeting magic of being 20.No one can explain this now, but for a long time and probably for many reasons, there was one topic they never discussed.Whenever the apartment door opened back then, the polyphony of funk included hints of day-old pizza, mangled chicken parts and sweat. So much sweat. One summer, they had to lay down cardboard in Nowinski’s car so they wouldn’t soak through the upholstery.Nowinski was 285 pounds. Tight end Chris Eitzmann was a sturdy 250. The runt, Larkee, was 225. Some years a dozen football players piled into the same suite, competing for microwave space and arguing over whose turn it was to empty the trash, which was usually overflowing with beer cans and animal bones.“They weren’t barbarians,” says Mikaela Eitzmann, the tight end’s college girlfriend and eventual wife. “But the whole place was definitely like a closet door that had shut some socks inside for a while.”This being Harvard, football players weren’t exactly NFL-or-bust meatheads. Sure, they would deliberately eat foods they knew wouldn’t agree with them just to wage gastrointestinal war on the others. And, yes, survival and acceptance meant an onslaught of insults. Daigle was the great Texas pontificator. Alex Garcia was the slovenly Californian who showed affection to friends by choking them. Nowinski was the suburban Chicagoan who serenaded his roommates, whether they liked it or not, with favorites from when he played Diesel in his high school performance of “West Side Story.”When you’re a JetIf the spit hits the fanYou got brothers aroundYou’re a family man.Eitzmann mostly rolled his eyes. The roommates never had much ammo on him, other than him being a slow-talking plowboy. He had grown up alongside the corn stalks and milo husks of Hardy, Neb., population 179, contemplating a future beyond the plains.He was tall and blond, with piercing blue eyes and a layer of wide-eyed innocence the other players couldn’t crack. Eitzmann tutored classmates and rarely missed Sunday services at University Lutheran on Harvard Square. He turned down a roster spot with the mighty Nebraska Cornhuskers to become the first graduate of his high school to enroll at an Ivy League school. This made him a local celebrity and heartthrob, so when Mikaela graduated from high school a year after Eitzmann, she moved east to enroll at Boston College.“I was young and had a crush,” she says, “probably like all girls did within a 100-mile radius.”He drank beer, but nobody remembers him losing control or puking on the sofa. Other roommates, sure. But Eitz? He had too many things he wanted to accomplish, this spit-shined drive that pushed away temptation and muffled the pressure of being the first Nebraskan to suit up for the Crimson varsity since the 1960s.“Even his swear words were wholesome,” says Will Burke, Eitzmann’s first Harvard roommate. “It was like Superman landed on Earth and was like, ‘I’ve got to figure out these Earthlings,’ and he just crushes it.”The practice field is where he went into Cyborg Mode, blasting into defenders at every turn. Nobody thought much about concussions then, and there was nobody to warn players about long-term effects or urging them to sit out. Getting your bell rung was a badge of honor, every hit part of a daily competition for masculinity and bragging rights.“If I didn’t come off the line as fast and strong as I could, I was losing,” says Daigle, a defensive end who often squared off against Eitzmann. “I was hitting people with the front of my head as often as I could.”Two days after Yale beat Harvard in 1998, the team gathered in Boston for its annual postseason banquet. Among Harvard’s many traditions is a particularly sacred one: Since 1873, football players have voted on one teammate as captain, the locker room’s leader and a symbol representing more than just talent. Joe Azelby, Dan Jiggetts and Ryan Fitzpatrick are among the luminaries.The underclassmen wrote names on slips of paper and passed them to the coaches. That night Coach Tim Murphy announced Christopher John Eitzmann as captain of the 1999 Harvard Crimson.“First of all, how in the world did I ever get to Harvard?” Eitzmann told a Nebraska newspaper reporter later. “I never could have dreamed all this would have happened to me.”There was no honorary kegger or roommates-only whiskey toast — not for Eitz. All anyone remembers is the pride that one of them, the obvious one, had made it. It was a feeling they knew they would be talking about — and probably ribbing him about — when they returned to campus as old men, their bond everlasting and shatterproof.When you’re a JetYou’re a Jet all the wayFrom your first cigaretteTo your last dyin’ day.The friends scattered after graduation: Larkee to Paris to play for a club football team, Burke to Hollywood to try comedy, Daigle back home to guard the Texas-Mexico line for the Border Patrol.Eitzmann did what they all expected: overachieved and earned a roster spot with the New England Patriots. He moved in with two new roommates not far from Foxboro Stadium. Defensive end David Nugent was all right, but what a stiff the other guy was. When Burke visited, he pleaded with Eitzmann to keep their plans secret from Tom Brady, a robotic and humorless rookie quarterback.“Let’s ditch this f---ing loser,” Burke says he insisted more than once. “God, he was boring.”A thousand miles south, Nowinski was searching for a place of his own. He had worked for a pharmaceutical consulting firm in Boston his senior year, but he wasn’t passionate about it. A colleague suggested that with his size, athleticism and big personality, he would make a great pro wrestler. Before Harvard, he had never followed the sport. But his roommates did, and during wrestling’s late-1990s golden age, Monday nights belonged not to the NFL’s weekly prime-time game but to Stone Cold Steve Austin, D-Generation X and the New World Order.Nowinski enrolled in wrestling school in Atlanta and landed a spot on a reality show in which the winner received a contract with WWE. Two contestants were named Chris, so producers called Nowinski “Chris Harvard.” He finished second but earned a spot anyway and made his televised debut in 2002, playing the role of an elitist pretty boy in a Harvard letterman’s jacket.He insulted the audience’s intelligence, thrashed competitors with a book of quotes, delighted in the crowd’s chants of “Har-vard sucks! Har-vard sucks!”“He got a taste of being the bad guy and just loved it,” says Kacyvenski, a former Crimson linebacker who was the only former roommate drafted by an NFL team.Nowinski got his buddies free tickets and backstage passes. They watched as he took a “Singapore cane” to the face, a power bomb from the Undertaker, a beatdown from Scott Steiner after Nowinski criticized the Iraq War during an in-ring political debate. It was all scripted, of course, but Nowinski occasionally took real bumps and bruises with him to the bar afterward. Still, as he greeted fans and signed autographs, a few longtime friends believed he had never been happier.During a match in 2003, Nowinski charged toward an opponent named Bubba Ray Dudley, expecting the painless kick they had rehearsed. But he reached the corner an instant early, catching Dudley’s boot just under his chin. He crumpled to the mat and felt pain ripping through his head. He’s still not sure what happened next.A trainer asked whether he was okay, and Nowinski lied and said he was fine. Later, he lay on the locker room floor for a half-hour and again told the trainer he was okay. Days passed. WWE’s next show was in New York, and he was still experiencing nausea and memory loss. There were no concussion protocols then, in wrestling or anywhere. Nowinski planned to report his symptoms to WWE’s medical team, but upon arriving and seeing wrestlers being treated for “real injuries,” he says of knee and back and shoulder problems, he left, kept silent and prepared for the night’s match, which he lost after being dropped through a table.He just lived with it because that’s just what you did. Wrestling legends didn’t complain; they jumped off cages and spit out cracked teeth. Football players didn’t sit out because they saw stars after a big hit; they modeled their games after Jack Tatum’s and Ronnie Lott’s because that earned you a spot on highlight montages and a bust in Canton, Ohio. A man didn’t tell his bosses or even his friends that he was in agony because that meant he was soft.“I’m not going to tell them I had a headache,” he says. “I just didn’t want to say anything.”One night in 2003, Nowinski was in Indianapolis when he saw his then-girlfriend falling and leaped forward to catch her. But Nowinski was actually asleep, acting out a dream in a hotel room. His brain was so injured it was conjuring visions without waking him. When his eyes opened, he had no idea why there was broken glass on the floor, why the nightstand was busted, why he had been clawing at the wall as his girlfriend sat on the bed crying, horrified by what she had seen.For years after they graduated, the roommates would return to Cambridge each fall. A few would pound beers at Harvard football tailgates, do shots, sip from a flask. Never Eitzmann. He was the Golden Boy, just sickeningly perfect. Even after a hip injury ended his NFL career in 2002, he came out on top.He married Mikaela, completed his master’s requirements at Dartmouth, got a job as a hedge fund manager in Boston. The couple had their first son, and three more children would follow, all healthy and beautiful. They adopted a Vizsla, went on ski trips to New Hampshire, bought a six-bedroom house in Wellesley, Mass., and a cabin overlooking New Hampshire’s Squam Lake. Eitzmann raced bicycles on weekends, went elk hunting in Colorado, kept Mikaela laughing and never feeling unsafe, a live-action postcard from a utopian life.“The dream couple,” Nicole Nowinski says. “These beautiful people with the beautiful love story, and they were both so humble and lovely. They really were these Harvard Barbies.”Chris Nowinski’s path had become rockier. He never wrestled again. He had nightmares and dizziness, and if his heart rate increased, a wave of nausea would hit. He became sensitive to bright lights and friends who asked when he would return to the ring. Doctor visits alternated between confusing and pointless, with Nowinski being assured his symptoms would disappear. Weeks, though, became months. Depression set in.Eventually, in 2003, a friend with WWE got him an appointment with Cantu, the renowned Boston-area neurosurgeon whose analysis of a concussion was different from that of the NFL. The league office at the time considered it a singular, “trauma-induced” event. Cantu, though, believed a concussion was less an injury than the first link in a longer chain of mental malfunction — a continuing process in which cells experience an outage and hastily attempt to rewire themselves and get back online as quickly as possible. This can take weeks or even months. When the new connection is made, the injured neurons and nerve cells are abandoned, left to die by the brain’s own survival blueprint. With enough injuries, the brain can become a graveyard of scar tissue that can cause chronic symptoms and dramatically alter judgment and behavior.1/3Cantu asked Nowinski how many concussions he had had. He had no idea. Zero? He had never been formally diagnosed, neither at Harvard nor by WWE. So Cantu asked whether he had ever blacked out, had double vision, felt dizziness after a hit, gotten his bell rung? Nowinski thought back and counted more than a half-dozen such instances. Potentially far more.“I had been banging my head for 19 years without any real consideration for what it could be doing to me,” Nowinski says. Cantu diagnosed Nowinski with post-concussion syndrome, and Nowinski says some effects never went away. He and Cantu kept talking.“Shouldn’t athletes know about this?” Nowinski asked.“People don’t listen to doctors,” Cantu said.“Maybe I’ll take a crack.”Now set adrift professionally, Nowinski spent his newfound free time reading concussion studies and interviewing athletes and doctors. He analyzed the work of Bennet Omalu, the controversial pathologist who discovered unusual protein buildup in NFL legend Mike Webster’s brain, the first link between football and CTE. Nowinski compiled his findings into what would become a book titled “Head Games.”As he wrote, Nowinski called his former Harvard teammates to share his discoveries and ask for their experiences. Some were intrigued. Others, not so much. The NFL disputed Omalu’s findings, with a league-appointed neurologist saying Webster died not because of brain trauma but because he had been a smoker, suffered from depression and been in generally poor health. Omalu also found evidence of CTE in the brains of former NFL players Justin Strzelczyk, Terry Long and Andre Waters, the latter two of whom died by suicide.“Just because [suicide] happened to a few football players,” the league’s top concussion expert, neurologist Ira Casson, said in 2007, “doesn’t mean it’s linked to football.”So, Nowinski’s old roommates wondered, why was he attacking the game? Was he so bitter that he hadn’t gotten a shot at the NFL that he was going to bring down the entire sport? Or was this just Nowinski the heel, an attempt to regain his bygone WWE attention?“To put it bluntly,” Mikaela says, “I think everybody thought it was bulls--t.”One former roommate refused to read an early draft of his manuscript. Another accepted a copy but never opened it. Larkee, by then a coach at Harvard, had no interest. So when he and Nowinski talked, they just avoided the topic and suppressed their feelings. If Nowinski brought it up, Larkee walked away.“I’m right there with these young college-aged kids, putting them through tackling reps, so we could have had that conversation: ‘What are we doing? What’s the best thing for these guys?’ ” Larkee says now. “But I think we both know we would disagree on pretty much everything.”At the Harvard tailgate in 2006, not long after “Head Games” was published, Nowinski brought books to give friends gathered around a fire. Many rolled their eyes at Nowinski being Nowinski, proselytizing about the evils of football at a football tailgate to a bunch of ex-football players.“He was screaming,” Daigle says. “But nobody was listening.”Daigle had helped Nowinski edit chapters of his manuscript and grown curious about his former roommate’s conclusions. Daigle’s father and grandfather both played college football; his grandpa died of Alzheimer’s disease, and his father is 72 and has dementia, Daigle says.“How much of that is genetic? How much of that is football?” Daigle says. “My future is definitely clouded by, what have I done to myself?”He would regret this later, but Daigle climbed into the bed of a pickup during the Harvard tailgate. Emboldened by a few beers and the promise of a laugh from his ex-teammates, he raised a copy of Nowinski’s book. Has anyone here suffered a concussion? he asked. Should any of this spell the end of football?Then Daigle climbed down, took another long pull off his beer and tossed the book into the fire.The Eitzmanns loved Halloween. One year they dressed as a 1920s gangster and flapper, Mikaela in a dark suit and fedora, Chris in a sequined dress and heels. Mikaela carefully applied his mascara. Another year, he was Wilt Chamberlain, short-shorts challenging the limits of comfort and decency.In 2008, Chris dressed as Axl Rose, but because Mikaela had to watch Coen, their infant son, before her nursing shift the next morning, she skipped the Halloween party at a bar in Boston. At 3 a.m., Chris still wasn’t home. He didn’t answer Mikaela’s calls. She called hospitals and police departments, eventually learning her husband had been arrested for drunken driving.When he got home, Chris made excuses. He hadn’t had that much. The officer was just a jerk. All he had really done was roll through a stop sign.Chris was a social drinker, Mikaela says now, but he was always in control. He had never put himself or anyone else in danger. But was that true? Had she spent years ignoring signs of a worsening problem?“He was so good at telling me, ‘I’m all right, I’m all right,’ ” she says.Now on alert, Mikaela began to notice lipstick on his shirt and charges for $500-a-night hotel rooms. He would disappear to the lake house sometimes, claiming he needed to focus on work. Why couldn’t Mikaela understand that? Why wouldn’t she give him space? He couldn’t be reached for hours or days, again saying he needed to work late.“He was slowly unraveling,” she says, “and I just didn’t see it.”She ignored evidence Chris had been with another woman because, she says, it wasn’t worth the explosion. She waited until after he had coached Coen’s flag football game one morning to tell Chris his breath was a thick fog of rum. He calmly walked into their baby daughter’s room that day, gave her a hug and drove away. An hour later, Chris called and said he was in a hotel in Woburn, a half-hour north, about to kill himself.“I was paralyzed,” Mikaela says. “I had no idea what to do. No one would believe me. Who would believe me?”She called the police, who took him into custody and tested his blood alcohol concentration. It was 0.44, Mikaela says. When a taxi later dropped him off, Chris apologized, hugged Mikaela and begged her not to tell anyone. When she agreed, he put on his suit and left for work carrying a bottle of wine. A gift for his assistant, he assured his wife.“I didn’t really believe that, but I was so terrified of making him mad,” Mikaela says. “I feel like this major wuss, and I’m really not like that. But I just loved him so much, so I wanted our marriage to be okay and I wanted him to be okay, so I just talked myself into believing him and believing it was all going to be okay.”Months could pass without arguments or threats, a sign Chris was improving. Mikaela kept telling herself that. Their life was peaceful, loving, as perfect as everyone believed. She told herself that, too. They went to Harvard alumni events and socialized with old friends. If Chris had alcohol on his breath, Mikaela just smiled and kept their secret. Then one day in 2016, when Chris was 39, he came home and announced that he was planning to drive off a bridge. Another time he said he was going to Colorado to veer off an embankment.After Mikaela’s father died in 2017, they agreed to go home to Nebraska and take over the family farm. A change would be good for them. Then, in 2019, Chris got drunk and buckled the kids into the car to go boating, and Mikaela stopped him. She insisted he enter rehab, and he agreed to report to a facility in Arizona. They flew there together, Chris in the window seat and Mikaela on the aisle, and soon after takeoff, Chris fell asleep as the two held hands.Fighting tears, Mikaela unlocked her phone and took a picture. This, of their clasped hands, would be the “before” photo, back when things got crazy that one time. She told herself a dream life built once could also be rebuilt. Soon Chris would be sober and recalibrated, and they would be smiling in their next picture together, their bond stronger for this, and looking happy, just as they always had.Rehab doesn’t always work the first time, and for Eitzmann it didn’t work the second, third or fourth times, either. He would commit to it, get on a plane, then discharge himself or escape after a few days and go looking for a bar. Then he would come home.As a way to cope, Mikaela and their preteen son, Coen, developed a code for when Chris was drunk. It wasn’t Dad who would come through the door. It was “Earl.” And they must tread carefully because Earl might get loaded and go driving. He might threaten suicide or slide a pan of fish sticks into the oven and pass out.“Earl still had Chris’s memories, and he still had Chris’s desire to be part of a family. Chris was still in there, so we had to protect Chris,” Mikaela says. “We couldn’t make him upset, because then Earl might leave for good and Chris might never come back.”Mikaela and Coen hid Earl’s credit cards and keys, but he always found them. He accumulated five DWIs and would later fly to Boston to meet up with a woman he had met in rehab. He would spend $6,000 on a vacation to Costa Rica but never go, or he would disappear without announcement and sleep in a camper near the Kansas line.CTE had by then become ubiquitous, and an alarming number of former NFL players — Dave Duerson, Junior Seau, Aaron Hernandez — had taken their lives after unexplained behavioral changes. The NFL had implemented new rules to protect players from the most devastating hits, but for families across the country, the damage was done. Mikaela read about their symptoms, about the mysterious spirals that now felt familiar, and didn’t Chris complain years earlier of headaches and dizziness? Had he been experiencing depression when he refused to get out of bed all day? Had she ignored these signs, too?One evening on the sofa, Mikaela told her husband they could get through this — whatever this was — together. She suggested they call Nowinski, his old roommate. By then he had a doctoral degree in behavioral neuroscience and had testified before Congress; he had been nominated for Sports Illustrated’s sportsperson of the year in 2010 and ultimately pressured the NFL into acknowledging, for the first time in 2016, the connection between football and CTE.Nowinski was also a longtime family friend, so obviously he would be willing to —“I’ve taken care of it,” he said.But this was Earl, not Chris, and this is how fiendish he could be. Mikaela wanted to believe him when he said he already had spoken with Nowinski, and so she did. As she did when her husband claimed he had visited Nowinski in Boston and been put through a battery of tests and even an MRI exam. Nowinski had assured him, he insisted, that all of it had come back clean.There were two dozen former teammates on the group text, but when it came down it, only three could make it to Nebraska on short notice. So one day in January 2021, Larkee, Joe Mattson and Ryan Kauppila formed what they playfully called “The Extraction Team.” Their all-too-serious mission: Get Eitzmann to his fifth — and hopefully final — stint in rehab.Mikaela had finally broken. She could no longer believe her husband’s lies — or the ones she had told herself. But a side effect of covering for Eitzmann all these years was that now nobody believed how bad things really were. His work friends in Boston distanced themselves. Eitzmann’s parents and siblings accused Mikaela of giving up too early. Chris was gaining weight, looking good, getting better.“No, he’s not; he’s really bad,” Mikaela says she told them.“Because I had kept it a secret for so long, there was just no way I was ever going to get him the help he needed,” she says.So when Eitzmann needed one final assist, it was the old roommates who came through. One picked up the tab for the treatment. Another, a lawyer, checked state laws and arranged for Eitzmann to be admitted to the facility. Others chipped in money for gas and food, and a few more plotted the quickest route from Omaha to Boston.The evening before the Extraction Team deployed, the roommates remained skeptical that things were as dire as Mikaela had indicated. “I was completely in the dark,” Burke says, “because he wanted me to be.”When Eitzmann emerged from a restaurant alongside his parents, the trio almost didn’t recognize him. The muscular tight end was gone. In his place was a gaunt and pale figure wearing clothes that swallowed him.“A bag of bones,” Larkee says.They set off in a rented Tahoe, toward Des Moines and Chicago. The plan was to stop only for essentials. But the rehab place said that someone with Eitzmann’s level of dependency couldn’t just go 24 hours with zero alcohol. So, counterintuitive as it seemed, the friends were advised to limit him — but to let him drink.The friends talked trash, laughed at old stories, pointed out how fat and bald and gray they had become. Eitzmann alternated between grand proclamations about getting his family back and questions about his friends’ children and jobs. He talked to Larkee about the Crimson’s hopes against Yale the following season.“The exact normal Chris,” Mattson says. “There was some joy of being together and feeling the real love that existed between all of us.”They were somewhere in Ohio when Eitzmann fell quiet. He was sweating, and a tremor in his hand spread throughout his body. The Tahoe parked at a store, and Larkee had to physically block Eitzmann from going inside. Instead, Mattson and Kauppila went in and returned with cans of high-test hard lemonade. Eitzmann drained them, his tremor eased, and eventually he went to sleep.“We were all thinking: Just f---ing keep driving,” Mattson says. “Take a deep breath, keep the doors locked and see what happens when he wakes up.”After 24 intense hours, the SUV stopped outside a hospital in Brighton, Mass., just three miles from their old Harvard apartment. Someone came to help Eitz inside, and the three ex-roommates watched him disappear from within the idling SUV. They waited a while, the three of them, in case their friend tried to make a run for it, joking about who was still athletic enough to make a tackle.The 126th captain of Harvard football died alone, surrounded by bottles, on the couch of his $3,500-a-month apartment in South Boston. The medical examiner determined that Eitzmann’s heart and liver gave out, no longer able to defend against a daily assault of alcohol.Mikaela had last heard his voice five days earlier, when the kids called him on Christmas Eve. Eitzmann was slurring and unintelligible, and he ended the call after speaking with only two of his four children. That fifth rehab stint had ended almost immediately, after Eitzmann tested positive for the coronavirus and was discharged. The detox place in Millbury couldn’t hold him, and neither could the halfway house in Chestnut Hill. One night Mikaela got an alert that Eitzmann was trying to use his credit card at a restaurant in Boston, and Larkee agreed to go looking for him. He found his ex-roommate on Boylston Street, having a steak dinner and an old-fashioned.He drove him to a facility in Worcester but feared it was pointless. “He’s going to have to do it on his own,” Larkee remembers thinking.After Eitzmann’s death, his friends began looking for something to blame. Some of his hedge fund friends decided he had suffered from mental illness. A few relatives pointed to a family history of addiction. His brother wondered whether decades of seeming so put together, of trying to be the hero of every story, had gradually ripped him apart.“It looked like he was so good at everything, that it all came easy,” Nate Eitzmann says. “But he must’ve put an intense amount of pressure on himself to succeed, and what he was feeling inside versus what we were seeing on the outside were probably two different things.”During a Zoom call with the Harvard roommates later, Nowinski said Eitzmann’s family had donated his brain to be analyzed for CTE. The response startled Nowinski. A few of the men issued unequivocal rejections that football could be responsible, a vigorous defense of a game that remains a precious ingredient to both identity and social matrix.“Just look at the evidence: We’ve been playing football for a hundred-plus years. What are we talking about here?” Larkee says. “He had a drinking problem for other reasons, some classic reasons. Some childhood stuff, high-pressure job, just general depression and personality issues and those type of things, like any normal person in their mid-40s would become an alcoholic and lose their family. Football player or not, that classic horrible, tragic story.”He continues a moment later.“For his loved ones, if it makes them feel better that that was his problem, that it wasn’t his fault, then that’s fine. I think it was Eitzmann’s fault.”For more than a decade now, this tension has coursed through the friend group as Nowinski insisted that CTE would eventually “get one of us.” In response, friends say, the former roommates established a separate text thread that doesn’t include Nowinski. That’s where they sometimes call him an “opportunist,” one ex-teammate says, and compare him to an ambulance-chasing attorney.“There’s still so much unknown,” says a different friend, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect his privacy and relationship with Nowinski. “Genetics and trauma, the effect of alcohol on the brain — it probably is a blend. That’s not a good enough story for him.”Some are willing to concede Nowinski’s contributions to accountability and football player safety, which one friend calls a “blessing.” The NFL reported a 30 percent reduction in concussions from 2015 to 2020, and the National Institutes of Health acknowledged for the first time last fall that repetitive traumatic brain injuries cause CTE.For the most part, though, they do what men their age do: They just don’t talk about it.“We are sort of beating around the bush of directly asking each other: Where do you fall on this?” Daigle says. “Chris sees CTE everywhere he looks because that’s his life. Scott sees a lack of evidence of CTE because he sees hundreds of football players a year.“If we were skewing, it would probably be to Chris’s side but with a bias toward saying we are not ideologues like Chris is on this. If he could ban football, he would.”Last September, Nowinski traveled past the Overtime Grill and Lounge, where, over beers that night, he had been one of the only friends to say he regrets playing football. He continued past the cemetery where Eitzmann’s remains are buried, alongside dense cornfields, eventually turning off the paved road.When families donate a loved one’s brain, the neuropathologist who studies it conducts a virtual meeting to explain the results. Nowinski doesn’t usually sit in, but this time he did.“I didn’t want to treat Chris as another research case,” he says.Nowinski and Mikaela sat on the family’s L-shaped sofa, and Ann McKee, director of the brain bank at Boston University, appeared on a laptop screen. Coen, who turned 15 last month, watched from the cushion between them, while the other children were at school. Coen is looking more like his father each day. He stands like him, shoulders back, and has the same jaw line and curiosity Eitzmann once brought from Nebraska to Cambridge.Coen witnessed many of his father’s worst moments, so Mikaela believed he had earned the right to know their source. McKee explained that she had found severe Stage 2 CTE, or a considerable amount of scar tissue in his brain. It could have been the cause of his alcohol abuse and impulsive behavior, along with Eitzmann’s deteriorating cognitive function. Eitzmann’s fried circuit board had become a wasteland.“There was nothing we could’ve done,” Mikaela says. At first this was a relief, she says. But as she processed McKee’s diagnosis, Mikaela realized she had actually lost her husband long ago. She believed that photo she had taken of their hands in 2019, just before dropping him off at the rehab place in Arizona, documented their true end.“Looking back now,” she says, “I never really had my real Chris back. He was just never himself ever again. I don’t think he was himself for a really long time.”After McKee signed off, Nowinski turned to Coen. The boy just stared. His father had been a great man, Nowinski said, and Eitzmann’s death had shattered him. They all had idolized him at Harvard, where everyone was a big shot but none as big as Chris Eitzmann. He had just been born into a town, a state, a country in love with a violent game, as addictive and culturally important as it is brutal.But what happened, Nowinski continued, wasn’t inevitable for Coen or his three younger siblings, and neither did it suggest either of them would —Mikaela interjected. She thanked Nowinski for coming, for bringing understanding and closure, for retelling a few stories from happier times. But it was getting late, and Coen needed to head out soon. It was fall in Middle America, and the young man had a football game that night.Nowinski and Nicole were coming back from a beach trip with friends recently, their kids asleep in the back seat. The topic of Chris Eitzmann came up. Nicole saw her husband’s face tighten, his skin turn red, that common sight of a middle-aged man using everything within him to avoid crying.“It just hits so close to home,” Nowinski said once the wave passed.He had felt many emotions after Eitzmann’s death: sadness, regret, guilt. He talked about none of them. It wasn’t just that Superman was dead; it was that helping people is Nowinski’s job, and even he couldn’t save him. If only Eitzmann or Mikaela had asked. Or if Nowinski had checked in more frequently. Or paid closer attention.“It broke Chris, and he’s still very, very, very broken,” Nicole says. “He kind of just handled it like, unfortunately, like you guys tend to do: just crawled into a hole.”By the time Nowinski emerged, so had a different emotion: fear. Two decades after his last wrestling match, Nowinski still takes prescription medication to ease headaches that can last all day. Though he discontinued his sleepwalking medication a few years ago, he still has vivid, disturbing dreams. Still, if he wakes in the night or feels foggy or forgets something, this is evidence, Nowinski says, that he has CTE. Be it soon or years from now, a fate similar to Eitzmann’s — and his family’s — is inevitable.“I’ve seen this pattern,” he says, “over and over and over again.”Mikaela admits she enabled Eitzmann, lied for him, helped him keep his secret. “I protected him for a really long time,” she says. It’s a regret she will live with forever.Nicole says Nowinski rarely drinks and has never been aggressive or menacing. She says she watches and “charts” her husband’s every move, comparing them with those from 15 years ago, when they first met in Boston.“I run my little science experiments all the time,” she says. “How has Chris changed? If he gets angry about something, is this just typical Chris behavior or is this a new type of anger? Or if he just forgets something, is this something he normally forgets? The headaches scare me, the sleep scares me, but that’s also been an issue since Day 1.”But what if Nowinski were to hide the severity of his symptoms, as Eitzmann did? If he knows how to address them, it stands to reason he also knows how to conceal them.“Chris is the love of my life and my best friend,” she says. “But I have to put my children first. His connections in the science field, they’re my connections as well. I’ve always been, in the back of my head, prepared for that, if it’s pretty or not. That’s my plan, just kind of go to his people —”She pauses, considering what it would mean to actually do what she’s describing.“— behind his back,” she continues, “and just ask for help.”For now, Nicole says, her objective is to listen and be supportive, even if Nowinski doesn’t want to talk. It’s to make him feel safe, she says, when he feels insecure or afraid and assure him they’re in this — whatever this is — together. On this late afternoon, Nowinski turned off the interstate as twilight approached. Nicole sat in the passenger seat of their SUV and leaned over. She looked at the sky and pointed out the orange and pink and purple streaks emerging.She gripped his hand as they drove, and Nowinski seemed calmer now as they listened to music and searched for new colors. Nicole squeezed tighter, a gentle reminder to her husband that she was there, would stay there, and that a day’s earlier moments don’t necessarily foretell how vibrant and lovely the sunset can sometimes be.",

      "title": "Ethen Frank, a talent out of Nebraska, sees opportunity with the Caps",
      "text": "HERSHEY, Pa. — Ethen Frank was already on his way to a memorable rookie season with the Hershey Bears when he received a questionnaire from the American Hockey League. It asked Frank to rank the seven events he might want to participate in at the all-star skills challenge. He scanned it. The shooting challenges made him nervous and took too long, he thought to himself, so he listed the fastest skater event as his preference and sent the survey back.When it came time to compete in the event in Quebec in February, Frank skated his lap as hard as he could. When he finished, he looked back at the clock on the ice: 12.915 seconds. No AHL or NHL player had ever bettered 13 seconds in the event, he was later told, and Frank was eventually summoned to the Hall of Fame in Toronto. He delivered the black Bauer skates he used — with “Franky” written just above the blades — to be put on display.A few weeks after the milestone, Frank signed a two-way contract with the Washington Capitals for next season.Frank arrived in Hershey at an opportune time: His 30-goal rookie season helped the Bears earn a Calder Cup playoff berth, and he positioned himself as an intriguing prospect for the Capitals, who have one of the NHL’s oldest rosters and are trying to retool their lineup with more speed and youth.“The opportunities are probably going to arise sooner or later,” Frank said in an interview last month. “So as long as you keep your head down and work hard, I’m sure the chips will fall where they may.”It has been a surreal year for Frank, who grew up in Papillion, Neb., a suburb of Omaha that isn’t a hockey hotbed. Frank was obsessed with the game from an early age — he had Fathead posters of Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby on his bedroom walls — but he largely learned to skate by playing roller hockey on asphalt.“I give pretty much all of my credit to that and my dad for teaching me how to skate. I didn’t really do a whole lot being from Omaha. There’s not a ton of skating coaches or anything like that out there,” Frank said. “My dad always said, ‘Speed kills.’ ”Frank honed that speed on a youth hockey team that traveled all over the Midwest to compete in tournaments. His coaches fought to get him and his teammates in front of scouts, which eventually landed Frank at Western Michigan University, where he played for five years after two seasons were shortened because of the coronavirus pandemic.At 25, he’s older than most AHL rookies. There were stretches during his first year when the league’s grueling schedule — often featuring long bus trips and three games in three days — exhausted him. But he turned in one of the best rookie seasons in Hershey in recent years: Frank led the team in goals, power-play goals and shots. He closed the regular season with his first hat trick to push his total to 30 goals, the most by a Bears rookie since Craig Fisher scored a rookie franchise record 43 in 1990-91.“He’s been taking positive strides throughout the whole season. The next step is to see how he performs in the playoffs. That’s the next area of growth,” Hershey Coach Todd Nelson said. “I wouldn’t say this is a surprise. We knew he had skill. But he’s taken it to the next level. I think there is a lot of positives in the future for him.”The Capitals have a handful of young forwards they brought into the mix late in the season after the team was eliminated from playoff contention, including Beck Malenstyn, Joe Snively and Henrik Borgstrom. There are others who figure to be in the mix once training camp starts, including Connor McMichael, who was shuffled between his natural position of center and the wing during his stints with Washington over the past two seasons.At 5-foot-10 and 178 pounds, Frank is an undersized forward who offers Washington dynamic speed and scoring ability. He’s expected to bring that to training camp before next season, where he’ll try to catch the eye of a new Capitals coach.It isn’t new territory for Frank. He was always working to get noticed as a little-known prospect from Nebraska. In Hershey, he had to prove he could handle the rigors of professional hockey, which provided the stage for him to show off his speed during the all-star skills challenge, take a trip to the Hall of Fame and eventually earn an NHL contract.“Pretty humbling signing that contract,” he said. “It’s kind of been a long ride. That’s always been the dream goal.”",

      "title": "With an app-fueled ownership structure, Mage is the people’s horse",
      "text": "BALTIMORE — The Pimlico Race Course winner’s circle is a grassy, hedge-lined ring near the finish line where, on the third Saturday of each May, the new Preakness champion, draped in a blanket of black-eyed Susans, is paraded past  TV cameras and VIPs to be met by his jubilant connections. Typically the milieu of white-haired owners and rosy-cheeked grandchildren, the circle also hosts the occasional dignitary, from princes of Saudi Arabia to sitting governors of Maryland to — 50 years ago this week — Secretariat himself.But if a certain chestnut colt should win the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, thus securing the second leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown, the scene in the winner’s circle could be unlike any in the century-and-a-half history of this race — with the gathering of millionaires and grizzled horsemen likely to be infiltrated by dozens of raucous, 30-something newbies whose ownership micro-shares in the horse known as Mage were obtained for as little $50.In other words, it would be not at all unlike the scene that unfolded two weeks earlier at Churchill Downs — where Mage, a lightly raced 15-1 shot with a charming backstory and an unusual ownership structure, outran 17 rivals to win the Kentucky Derby. In the chaos of the winner’s circle, when they finally lined up everyone who owned a piece of Mage, the photographers shooting the traditional victory photo may have had to switch to a wider lens.Mage wins Kentucky Derby after run-up rife with scratches and tragedy“It looked like the cover of ‘Sgt. Pepper’s,’ ” joked Ramiro Restrepo, one of Mage’s controlling owners, speaking of the resulting photo, with its teeming horde of cocktail-toting, ballcap-wearing investor bros, who numbered more than 100. (In reality, the collage on the front of the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” contains far fewer faces.)It is true, however, that Mage — a true champion of the people, in the most literal sense possible — is the closest thing horse racing has to a rock star at the moment and the best shot at a redemptive storyline for a beleaguered sport that sometimes appears to be on the verge of collapsing under the weight of equine deaths and doping scandals. Such as the ones that occurred in the run-up and aftermath of the Derby.“That’s why I say Mage was like a gift from above,” said Brian Doxtator, co-founder and CEO of Commonwealth Racing, the “fractional investment platform” that, along with 391 micro-investors who bought in via its app, owns 25 percent of Mage. “The timing of it for our business, our customers and for horse racing couldn’t be better. And horse racing did need this. … I do think we’re putting a slightly different lens over horse racing. And it is at a critical juncture for the industry at this moment.”Svrluga: The Preakness is coming, and all of horse racing holds its breathThere is a ragtag, underdog charm with almost all of Mage’s human connections: His jockey, Javier Castellano, snapped a career 0-for-15 Derby skid with the win. His trainer and co-owner, Gustavo Delgado Sr., is a legendary horseman in his native Venezuela, where he won that country’s version of the Triple Crown four times, but had never finished better than 12th in two previous tries in the Derby. Co-owner Restrepo is a gregarious, fifth-generation horseman with Colombian roots and a knack for blowing past his budget.“One heck of a melting pot,” Restrepo said of Mage’s collective connections following the Derby win.It was only a year ago this week that Restrepo and Gustavo Delgado Jr. — the trainer’s son and assistant — first laid eyes on Mage at an auction of 2-year-olds that took place at the Timonium Fairgrounds, just a few miles up Interstate 83 from Pimlico. Told by Delgado Sr. not to exceed the budget of $100,000, Restrepo and Delgado Jr. decided they could probably go to $200,000 if they needed to — then stayed in the bidding for the horse they desperately wanted until they finally got him for $290,000.That horse, from the first crop sired by 2018 Kentucky Derby runner-up Good Magic, out of the Big Brown mare Puca, was Mage. Though the purchase barely caused a ripple across the industry at the time — 25 horses fetched higher prices at that auction, including one, Hejazi, that went for $3.55 million — it would change the course of history.“It was intuition. We had to have him,” Delgado Jr. said. “I told Ramiro, we’re going to go after him, and then we’ll figure out where the money was going to come from.”That budgetary overreach — and the financial scrambling that followed — is what led the cash-strapped new owners of Mage, several weeks later, to Commonwealth, a 2019 start-up in the fractional investing space that had had a massive breakthrough in 2022, when its horse Country Grammer won the $12 million Dubai World Cup.Greenberg: Odds, post positions and analysis for the 2023 Preakness StakesOnce Doxtator and Commonwealth partner Chase Chamberlin agreed to go in on a quarter of the horse — plus their share of two years of annual training expenses — it was time to offer him to the app’s users, who numbered around 6,500 at the time. Shares were $50 each, and while shareholders could profit from both race earnings and eventually stud fees, anyone who knows anything about horse racing understands many more investments turn into duds than turn into Kentucky Derby winners.But Commonwealth sees its mission less as a microinvesting tool than as a community-builder. It sells an experience as much as it does a racehorse. Because its investors had owner status, they could visit the paddock before races and — should everything break just right — the winner’s circle afterward.“People focus on the financials, but what we’re actually trying to do is build a community of sports fan — I call them the ‘big day out’ crowd,” Doxtator said. “These are people that invite five of their friends to the track or to a golf tournament. Or these are music festival-goers. These are people who are accustomed to [bringing along] four or five of their friends. They don’t just go do it themselves. … We get $50 shareholders in the paddock all the time. I hear them say all the time, ‘You can’t do anything like this for 50 bucks.’ ”Greenberg: Root for Mage in the Preakness Stakes, but look elsewhere for betsWhen Mage’s offering went live on the Commonwealth app in January, it took just 48 hours for shares to sell out. Three hundred ninety-one users bought in, with investments ranging from $50 to $20,000. More than 100 of those Commonwealth investors traveled to the Derby, with seats scattered all around Churchill Downs.“We told them going in, ‘We can’t make any guarantees [about access].’ First of all, this was our first Kentucky Derby, too,” Doxtator said. “We didn’t know how it was going to work.”In the wild aftermath of Mage’s improbable win, the Commonwealth crowd — distinguished by white “Mage” caps — converged upon the winner’s circle, initially overwhelming the security personnel. “There’s all these people pouring in,” Doxtator recalled. “I think the [security guards] were finally like, ‘Okay, if they have the hat on, we’ll let them in.’ ”A bunch of the delirious Commonwealth users — some of whom, and this simply can’t be reiterated enough times, bought in for just 50 measly bucks — lingered in the winner’s circle long enough to take turns kissing the trophy.Bob Baffert returns to the Triple Crown stage — and a reeling sportThanks in large part to a brief mention on NBC’s telecast of the Derby, Commonwealth saw more than 6,000 new users sign up in the first 48 hours afterward. Doxtator, 40, and Chamberlin, 32 — childhood friends from Kalamazoo, Mich. — fielded so many media inquiries, they enlisted another friend to help them out as a PR contact. Among the many industry calls they fielded were some from agents from the worlds of golf and tennis: In the coming months, Commonwealth plans to branch into those sports, with PGA Tour rookies Joey Vrzich and Cooper Dossey having already signed on.Commonwealth wasn’t the first company to offer micro-shares of a racehorse or even the first to win the Kentucky Derby; MyRacehorse had a piece of 2020 champion Authentic. But perhaps because of their youth and their backgrounds in tech start-ups, Doxtator and Chamberlin have found a foothold with a younger, more tech-savvy crowd; Doxtator said the average age of a Commonwealth user is 36, decades younger than the average thoroughbred owner, and a new user can go from downloading the app to buying a share in about 90 seconds.And while the minimum cost for a share of Authentic through MyRacehorse was $206, Commonwealth made sure to aim lower with Mage.“We’re trying to democratize this sport,” Doxtator said.Across the embattled industry, people have taken notice. Dalmore Group, the broker-dealer through which Commonwealth offers its investments, said in a statement that Mage’s Derby win “sent ripples through the horse racing community.”“This democratization of the sport has the potential to make horse racing more inclusive,” Dalmore said. “Mage’s victory in the Kentucky Derby is a testament to the power of fractional ownership and its potential to revolutionize the horse racing industry. … The sport of kings is no longer reserved for just a privileged few.”Meanwhile, for the 391 Commonwealth users who bought in to Mage, the Derby win resulted in a $95 payout for each $50 they invested — on top of their initial investment — which is still far less than what that same $50 would have gotten them at the betting window, where a $2 win bet returned $32.42. But based on the stallion offers Commonwealth is already fielding for Mage once his racing career is over, Doxtator estimates those $50 shares will eventually be worth at least $500 each.And anyway, the money is only a small part of the draw. Watching a horse — your horse — charge to the finish line in front of the pack, then making your way down to the winner’s circle to celebrate another jewel in the Triple Crown and kiss another trophy? Whether you’re in for a gazillion or just 50 bucks — such a thing would be priceless.",

      "title": "Analysis | Durability was Max Scherzer’s superpower. Not so much these days.",
      "text": "Max Scherzer never used to be the kind of ace people worried about.Here, at Nationals Park, that was Stephen Strasburg, the guy who might find himself aching at any moment, the one for whom trainers stood ready on the top step. Scherzer played 6½ years in Washington. Only once did he go on the injured list. If Strasburg was hurt, well, at least the Nationals had Scherzer.In the New York Mets’ dugout, the ace they worried about was Jacob DeGrom. He was the one they worried would throw a pitch, shake his arm and walk off into a few months of oblivion. Before the 2022 season, the Mets signed Scherzer to be the sure thing, the steady ace they struggled to develop for the last half-decade as Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard and others watched their careers devolve into fragility, too. Even at his age, Scherzer was a known commodity. The Mets knew Scherzer would take the ball.But by the time Scherzer took the mound at Nationals Park on Sunday, no one — including Scherzer himself — knew exactly what the 38-year-old with the 5.56 ERA had to give. The answer, for one day, was that he had enough.“Physically good enough that I will be able to avoid the IL and now get back in the routine and get going,” Scherzer said. “That’s the most important thing, to be able to avoid the IL, be out there, be healthy and throw the ball well.”Scherzer threw five innings of one-run ball against a Nationals lineup that has MLB’s 26th-highest OPS but has proved it is not a pushover. His fastball touched 96 a few times — not as often as it used to but as often as he needed. In the second game of what was basically a doubleheader, the Mets pulled him after just 83 pitches. He had not thrown his usual 100 pitches or so in a while. They had to be careful. Besides, he said, he was not at full cardio strength.“Actually, today, this was probably the most winded I’ve ever been in a start,” said Scherzer, who has made 427 of them in his career. “I was huffing and puffing. I wasn’t tired. I was just out of breath because the last six days I haven’t done a thing. I’ve been sitting in a neck brace. I feel like now I can get through this start, now I can get back in my routine, get my running in. That way I’m physically fit and can get out there and actually pitch better.”In the past, Scherzer’s seeming certainty that he is through the worst of things would be plenty of evidence the future Hall of Famer would be just fine. He always seemed to know exactly what was wrong and how long it would take to fix it; he seemed to know exactly when he was out of harm’s way or still at risk. These days require more skepticism. Scherzer has flashed normality at times during his Mets tenure, only to see something disrupt his ability to establish it consistently.“Max is probably the highlight [today], Max feeling good physically and getting through it,” Mets Manager Buck Showalter said. “He hasn’t been able to do a lot of cardiovascular work with this, and you could tell he was a little winded there toward the end. But I would have signed in blood for him to get through five innings and get his pitch count up.”People are counting on Dave Martinez. He knows it.Scherzer had not pitched since May 3 because of back soreness, then a neck spasm, and that day he gave up six runs in 3⅓ innings to the Detroit Tigers. Before that, he had not pitched since April 19 because he was serving a 10-game suspension for a sticky pitching hand. From 2015 through 2021, no one threw more innings than Scherzer, and it wasn’t close. This year, as of Mother’s Day, Scherzer has not thrown enough innings to qualify for league leads.He dropped his appeal of that suspension, which seemed out of character for a player who once offered to disrobe on the field when it was suggested he might be hiding sticky stuff on his belt. He said publicly he knew any appeal would be heard by Major League Baseball, so even if he repeated his explanation about using only legal substances, he probably wouldn’t win. What went unsaid was that serving a suspension gave Scherzer time to figure out how to deal with a balky back before it sent him to the injured list.Ultimately, he did avoid the injured list. But his return was delayed. So was his next start because Scherzer’s neck seized up last week, just like it did before Game 5 of the 2019 World Series, like it did every now and then during his Nationals tenure. In those days, he would wait a day or two and return, no worse for the wear.Yet as recently as Friday, Showalter was wondering whether Scherzer’s spasming neck would withstand a bullpen session. They have legitimate reason to wonder about Scherzer, about his oblique and his back and his neck, about all the things that have forced him to the injured list more times in the year and a half of his Mets career (three) than in his entire career beforehand. His velocity was down in his last start against the Tigers. He was getting fewer swings and misses this year than in any since 2014. His velocity looked better Sunday. The Nationals whiffed on 39 percent of the pitches at which they swung.“I don’t think he had to push to get to [his velocity]. You could see him in his other outings, he’d go get it some when he had to. But you could tell it was max effort to get there,” Showalter said. “It was pretty easy for him to get to today. The ball was coming out of his hand; you could tell from the dugout, it was coming out of his hand. You look for late life, and he had that late life he has when he’s effective.”So for today — and perhaps for five days from now, too — everything is fine. But no one used to even wonder. Scherzer would say the slew of injuries he has experienced with the Mets is mere coincidence, not the sign of an inevitable physical breakdown. Presented with the idea time might be catching up with him, Scherzer rejected it outright.“It’s baseball. Do you realize how many little things I’ve dealt with?” Scherzer asked, defiant, at his locker a few weeks ago. “Always. I’ve gone a whole year with 33 starts and only had three starts where I felt good. The other 30 I dealt with something. I once had a broken finger. I was miserable for a year and didn’t miss a start.”Scherzer argued the same thing one afternoon in spring training. He explained, injury by injury, moment by moment, how everything that has gone wrong since he got to the Mets was the result of something identifiable — not something anyone could chalk up to age. He knew exactly when he pushed too hard. He says he knows exactly what he needs to do to manage the back and neck long term. The one thing Scherzer doesn’t articulate — the one thing time might best explain — is why those aches and pains never used to stop him.Maybe he is back for good, fixed and whole, durable again. But the uncomfortable fact for Scherzer and the underachieving Mets is that these days, it is reasonable to wonder.",

      "title": "Perspective | Ja Morant’s friends aren’t the problem. His judgment is.",
      "text": "Ja Morant made yet another boneheaded decision, flashed a gun (again) and got slapped with a most laughable suspension by his team. Yet somehow, it was all his friend’s fault.The friend, Davonte Pack, went live Saturday on Instagram so he and a car full of grown men could stream their rap-a-long to the amusement of his followers. Morant was at the wheel, while the friend held up his phone from the passenger seat. Aside from the childish behavior they were exhibiting and the vulgar lyrics they were butchering, it appeared to be a light moment had by a couple of buddies. But Morant, the dynamic star of the Memphis Grizzlies, just had to show off his gun. Naturally, the blame fell on the one without the shoe and soft drink endorsements.Because in a society that conflates money with merit, the multimillionaire in love with gunplay is allowed second, third and eighth chances. Thanks to a public relations machine that builds a sympathetic narrative — and a gullible audience willing to soak it up — he can be portrayed as a protagonist awaiting redemption. The people he chooses to occupy his world are cast as the toadies who should take the fall.The friends are not afforded the same grace for being young and immature and needing to learn. They are viewed as the vices. The bad actors and evil influences who snake their way into the lives of the rich and admired. Even if the truth is they’ve been around before the money and fame, they are mislabeled as nefarious figures simply hanging on for a sliver of their friend’s spotlight.Grizzlies suspend Ja Morant after he appears to show gun in new videoThis is Morant’s second known incident involving a gun in the past three months; in March, he streamed himself on Instagram holding up a small gun while in a Denver nightclub. It follows a string of violent and troubling behavior of which he and others have been accused: punching a teenager at his home, threatening a Finish Line employee, acting like heavies inside a high school because someone called his sister a name. On Sunday, as the latest video spread on social media, Morant, 23, deservedly absorbed criticism. He also still managed to find those who watched the short clip and came away thinking, how could he? Not Morant. How could Pack do his friend that way?Former player Kwame Brown chastised Pack for knowing Morant had a gun in the car and recording anyway, while Los Angeles Lakers guard D’Angelo Russell offered advice on Twitter: “If you can’t change the people around you, change the people around you.” Others on the same platform also pinned this blunder on the friend.The friend should have never turned his phone toward Morant. But if that’s true, then maybe he should have never hit record. Or never even possessed a smartphone in the first place. When traveling with his very rich, very well-known, very tempestuous bestie, Pack should keep only a carrier pigeon to communicate with the outside world. That way, the next time Morant momentarily goes brain-dead, Pack can wrestle the firearm away, while the pigeon dispatches to the team of lawyers, agents and propagandists who can’t even wake up on Mother’s Day without learning their client is trending on Twitter.Pack has his own history in gangsta cosplay: He walked onto the court during a game against the Indiana Pacers in February and verbally confronted players. For that, he was banned from attending Grizzlies home games last season. In this duo, Pack isn’t exactly the levelheaded one. He, like Morant, is an intemperate young man obsessed with throwing away his future. It’s just that Morant can jump higher.Morant receives understanding and forgiveness, though he continues to show himself as audacious and defiant. Either he hasn’t learned from his previous eight-game suspension or he just doesn’t care about consequences. He is the star. Not only in the video but also in his life, where clearly he has rejected wise counsel for the company of fools. A carload of them, while Morant takes the captain’s seat.So, God help Ja Morant’s friend, the sidekick stuck riding shotgun. At least he tried.In Memphis, Ja Morant’s summer of trouble went unchecked by authoritiesPack tried to stop the backlash that would surely follow from Morant flashing a gun. He tried to shield the fact that this multimillionaire is so uncomfortable driving the streets on a sunny weekend day that he feels compelled to carry heat.Soon after Pack spiced up this carpool karaoke by making a gun gesture, the camera moved over to Morant, who was now dancing with an actual gun in his hand. Pack immediately dropped the phone. He tried to protect Morant and his brand. He was the one who seemed to have a modicum of common sense. Even though no one in that car appears to have learned not to play with guns, including his wealthy best friend, at least Pack realized he shouldn’t show it to the world.But Morant keeps showing us who he is. Not in the apologetic written statements, nor while being served up softballs by a non-journalist at ESPN so he can meekly say “the gun wasn’t mine.” Instead, Morant reveals himself through his actions.Surely in the coming days or weeks, we can expect to read and hear more contrition from Morant. More about the anxiety he suffers from or the therapy he’ll undergo while serving this offseason suspension, which was issued too late by the Grizzlies in an attempt to contain the problem child they helped create. Rather than rushing to absolve Morant and assigning culpability to his lesser-known friends, it’s time to believe Morant has the capacity to make terrible decisions all by himself. He doesn’t need anyone to lead him astray. And possibly, it is Pack who needs a better friend.Just like Morant, Pack is a young man too enraptured with searching for all the smoke. Except he’s viewed as the malevolent force in Morant’s master plan. The problem with that storyline is the video evidence. On Saturday, two friends were in a car. They were rapping and having a good time. Then, one pulled out a gun. Now, it’s hard to distinguish the parasite from the host.",

      "text": "It wasn’t supposed to happen this way for the team that led the NHL wire-to-wire, breaking records for success in the regular season.But Presidents’ Trophy winners have a habit of falling short in the Stanley Cup playoffs, and the Boston Bruins are the latest team to be eliminated in the first round, left stunned Sunday night by a 4-3 overtime loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 7 in Boston. The defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche experienced the same stinging deflation hours later in Denver, being eliminated, 2-1, by the second-year Seattle Kraken in another winner-take-all game.The Bruins were well aware of what was at stake, with winger Brad Marchand telling ESPN in March: “If you win the Presidents’ Trophy but you don’t win the Cup, nobody cares. That’s what we know on this team.”As offseason arrives, the Capitals prep for daunting challenges aheadEven the Panthers, who roared back from a 3-1 deficit in the series and forced overtime on a goal by defenseman Brandon Montour with a minute left in regulation, were in disbelief at the monumental accomplishment of having beaten the most successful team in NHL history, one that set records with 65 wins and 135 points.The Panthers have done the unimaginable 😱@FlaPanthers | #TimeToHunt pic.twitter.com/Ts42aUT8HE“It hasn’t sunk in yet,” forward Matthew Tkachuk told reporters. “The talent they have over there in Boston is unbelievable. That we were able to do what we did after what they did all year … the fact that we were able to beat them in the playoffs is crazy.”The end came on a goal by Carter Verhaeghe 8:35 into overtime, when Tkachuk screened Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman. The win sends Florida to a second-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs, who eliminated the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday for their first playoff series win since 2004.“I guess the words that come to mind right now are disappointment and confusion,” Bruins Coach Jim Montgomery said. He also used the word “stupefying.”At least the Bruins have company, thanks to a Presidents’ Trophy “curse.” Since the trophy was first awarded to the team with the best regular season record in the 1985-86 season, only 11 regular season champions have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals, with eight winning. Since the wild-card format came into being in 2013-14, no Presidents’ Trophy winner has advanced to the finals. The Panthers, last year’s Presidents’ Trophy winner with 122 points, perhaps had extra insight about the Bruins after losing in the second round of last year’s playoffs to Tampa Bay.“They had a crazy regular season,” Verhaeghe said, “but the playoffs are completely different. I mean, we had a crazy regular season last year, and it really didn’t amount to anything.”Colorado was also on the wrong end of history Sunday night, sent home with a loss in which the Kraken became the first team to eliminate the defending Stanley Cup champion in its first playoff series. Colorado has lost its past six Game 7s.“Within the group, we believe in ourselves,” Seattle forward Oliver Bjorkstrand, who had both Kraken goals, told TNT. “It’s been like that all series. … We knew what we had to do to come in here and win the game.”",

      "title": "Inside the NBA draft lottery room: Heartbreak for the Wizards ",
      "text": "CHICAGO — Brett Greenberg, the Washington Wizards’ baby-faced assistant general manager, leaned forward in his seat, realizing that his organization was now one ping-pong ball away from landing Victor Wembanyama. What’s more, the Wizards suddenly had better than a 50 percent chance at securing the right to draft the 7-foot-4 French phenom, who has inspired breathless comparisons to past teenage basketball prodigies such as LeBron James and Lew Alcindor. Just one more ping-pong ball.In the bowels of a byzantine convention center in downtown Chicago, history came so close to happening, but didn’t, for the Wizards.Greenberg and 13 other representatives were whisked through a metal detector and into a heavily guarded room where the NBA conducts its annual draft lottery an hour before ESPN’s nationally televised broadcast of the results. Phones, smartwatches and other electronic devices are barred from the room, forcing the small collection of team executives, league staffers and media members to track the results with pen and paper. To maintain suspense for the viewing audience, no one is allowed out of the room — not even for a bathroom break — until after the television broadcast is complete.Spurs win NBA draft lottery and right to select Victor WembanyamaThe lottery drawing process is straightforward: 14 numbered ping-pong balls are placed into a hopper. To determine which of the 14 lottery teams gets the No. 1 pick, four ping-pong balls are drawn. The 1,001 possible four-digit combinations are divvied up based on each team’s regular season record.The Wizards finished the season with a 35-47 record, giving them 67 possible four-digit combinations. That 6.7 percent chance to get the No. 1 pick gave Washington the eighth-best odds among the 14 teams present. Teams with worse records had better odds to land the top pick, while teams with better records had worse odds.NBA officials distributed an eight-page packet with all 1,001 possible four-digit combinations listed by team. Washington’s section comprised slightly more than half of page seven. As Greenberg surveyed the list, he realized that low numbers were bad for Washington: None of its combinations included 1, 2, 3 or 4.The drawing commenced with three very favorable numbers for Washington: 14, 5 and 8. With just one ball left to be selected out of 11 still in the hopper, the odds had swung dramatically in the Wizards’ favor. Remarkably, Washington held six of the remaining winning combinations.If the final number selected was 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13, the Wizards would get the chance to select the 19-year-old Wembanyama in the June 22 draft. In that brief moment before the final ball was selected, Washington’s shot at getting the top selection had skyrocketed from 6.7 percent to 54.5 percent. Better than a coin flip.Unfortunately for Washington, a dreaded low number emerged as the final digit: 2. The 14-5-8-2 combination was held by the San Antonio Spurs, who will surely add Wembanyama’s name alongside their two previous top overall picks: Hall of Fame centers David Robinson (1987) and Tim Duncan (1997).“There’s a special relationship between France and the Spurs because of Tony [Parker] and Boris [Diaw],” Wembanyama said Tuesday from Paris, referencing his two countrymen who won championships in San Antonio. “I know half of the country, if not the whole country, wanted the Spurs to have the first pick. Not to brag about it, but I knew what was going to happen. I actually recorded myself saying it this morning, walking to practice. The universe told me.”Spurs General Manager Brian Wright, seated one row in front of Greenberg, celebrated with a subdued fist pump and, later, a wide smile and congratulatory handshakes from the rival team representatives. San Antonio had entered the night with a 14 percent chance at the No. 1 pick.“You’re in the back with no phones and no way to communicate,” Wright said. “That adds to the level of anxiety. The numbers start to come up and you’re searching through the pages to see if you have it, then you realize it’s you. It’s just an incredible amount of excitement. Because of the anxiety, I haven’t eaten all day. If I pass out, excuse me.”Greenberg, who oversees basketball analytics and salary cap management for Washington, studiously tracked the lottery results on a notepad. He understood immediately how close the Wizards had come and recounted the 6-for-11 chance to Indiana Pacers President Kevin Pritchard, who sat to his right.As it turned out, misery loved company: Pritchard would have landed the No. 1 pick if the final digit had been a 6 instead of a 2. Across the room, Portland Trail Blazers assistant general manager Sergi Oliva realized that he would have won had the last digit been a 3.Remarkably, though, the Wizards were the only team to have more than one winning combination when it came down to the final digit: 1 belonged to the Houston Rockets, 2 belonged to the victorious Spurs, 3 to the Blazers, 4 to the Orlando Magic, 6 to the Pacers and all the rest to the Wizards.Washington has twice claimed the top lottery spot — Kwame Brown in 2001 and John Wall in 2010 — but this year was different because of the excitement that has surrounded Wembanyama since his breathtaking performances in two showcase games outside Las Vegas this past October. Since then, “Wemby” has averaged 21.6 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.1 blocks for Metropolitans 92 in France’s top professional league.Several NBA team executives believe Wembanyama’s economic impact on the Spurs could surpass $1 billion during his career, once ticket and merchandise sales, sponsorship revenue and the franchise’s valuation are taken into account.“He will never play in a game that’s not sold out,” Pritchard predicted. “I knew we had one [potential winning ping-pong combination]. I got really excited. We’ve never seen a player like Wembanyama. He is whatever he wants to become. There is no comparison. A unicorn but more.”Oliva, the Trail Blazers executive, wasn’t crestfallen after his near miss because Portland later jumped up to claim the No. 3 pick. When he returned to the lottery stage, he was warmly received by Trail Blazers General Manager Joe Cronin and team president Dewayne Hankins.“You have to go home happy,” Oliva said. “You can’t blame the process or the balls. We’ve got a great asset [with the No. 3 pick].”Washington wasn’t as lucky as San Antonio or even Portland. After missing out on Wembanyama, Greenberg sat and watched the rest of the lottery drawing play out. The Charlotte Hornets landed the second pick, Portland got third and the Houston Rockets earned the fourth selection. That left Washington in the same spot it started: eighth.Chaos has arrived in the NBA playoffs, and it might not be a fadThe past 10 players to be taken eighth range from busts to quality rotation players: Dyson Daniels, Franz Wagner, Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. While Wagner has all-star potential, there isn’t a billion-dollar global icon in the bunch.Seated on the television stage elsewhere in the McCormick Place convention center and unaware of what exactly had transpired in the drawing room, Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. kept a stone face when deputy commissioner Mark Tatum revealed Washington would select eighth. Minutes later, Spurs managing partner Peter J. Holt, pounded his table, joyously shouted, “Let’s Go!” and raced to hug Tatum once San Antonio was announced as the winner.“A little disappointing,” Unseld said. “One bright spot is we didn’t move back. We fell essentially where we were slotted, and we take some degree of solace in that.”Greenberg, a Maryland native who grew up a Wizards fan, declined to comment on how close the franchise had come to landing a savior, citing the ongoing search for former general manager Tommy Sheppard’s replacement. Considering the heartbreaking circumstances, there wasn’t much anyone could have said.Ava Wallace contributed to this report.Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

      "title": "The return of the base thief",
      "text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — From his spot a few paces off the first base bag, Terrell Tatum had all the data points he needed. He checked the positioning of the opposing infielders, studied the pitcher’s movements, glanced at the pitch clock ticking toward zero, noted the catcher rising slightly out of his crouch in anticipation of a throw to second. And he knew, from the readout on the stopwatch his first base coach was holding, the pitcher’s delivery time: 1.3 seconds.The one thing Tatum ignored: the third base coach’s box. That’s because Tatum, a speedy Chicago White Sox prospect with the Class A Winston-Salem Dash, didn’t require a “steal” sign from his third base coach. This season, for the first time in his pro career, he has the “green light” — permission to steal whenever he believes he can make it safely. It’s a gift that came with a few words of advice from the White Sox official who informed Tatum during spring training:“You’d better take advantage,” the official said, according to Tatum, “and go.”Major League Baseball launched a slate of rule changes in the big leagues this season, all to hasten the pace of the game and create more action. The most visible and scrutinized are the limitations on infield shifts and the introduction of the pitch clock to keep pitchers and batters from stalling.But for prospects such as Tatum whose toolboxes include exceptional speed, the more significant changes were the ones designed in part to increase stolen base attempts: enlarged bases that reduce the distance between the edges of the bags by 4½ inches and especially the disengagement rule that limits a pitcher to two pickoff attempts or step-offs (which restart the pitch clock) per plate appearance.The rules were used across the minors in 2022, so baseball officials had some insight into their effects. But their introduction this season to the major league game — in which change is usually both slow to come and permanent — has altered the way organizations value players’ ability to steal a base or keep their opponent from stealing one.Almost instantly, Tatum, a 23-year-old outfielder, could sense that his career prospects had just gotten an immeasurable boost.“I knew it right away,” Tatum said of the moment in September when news broke of MLB’s rule changes starting in 2023. “This was going to be huge for me. I knew I was going to be able to steal a lot more bases.”Already this season, the results have been striking: Through May 9, MLB teams have attempted stolen bases at a rate of 0.90 per game, a 24 percent jump over last season — a year-over-year increase that roughly mirrors what the minor leagues experienced via the new rules in 2022 and which is the highest since 2012. The success rate of 78.6 percent this year, meanwhile, would rank as the highest in modern baseball history.Baseball hasn’t seen a 50-steal season since 2017 (Dee Strange-Gordon, Billy Hamilton), a 70-steal season since 2009 (Jacoby Ellsbury) or an 80-steal season since 1988 (Rickey Henderson, Vince Coleman). This year, Oakland’s Esteury Ruiz, with 17 steals in the Athletics’ first 37 games, was on a 74-steal pace through May 9, with a handful of other players close behind. And the first-place Pittsburgh Pirates, with 48 steals in the season’s first 37 games, were on pace for 210 this year, which would be the most by any team since the 1992 Milwaukee Brewers stole 256.Meanwhile, in the high Class A South Atlantic League, Tatum — with 13 stolen bases in his first 23 games of 2023 (or 0.57 per game) — is stealing at a clip that is more than 40 percent higher than his rate during the first two years of his pro career.During a recent game at Truist Stadium, the Dash’s 5,500-seat stadium in Winston-Salem, Tatum, on first base following a two-out single, waited patiently for his opportunity to take off for second. As he danced off the bag, he angled his body about 20 degrees toward second base, a tip given to him in college by fellow North Carolina State product Trea Turner, now a two-time stolen base champ. It affords him a split-second head-start on the pivot toward second.Because the opposing pitcher for the Hickory Crawdads, a Texas Rangers affiliate, had a relatively quick delivery — 1.3 seconds, per the stopwatch, from the start of his motion to the ball landing in the catcher’s mitt — Tatum needed to be careful.“If it’s above 1.3, I feel like that’s almost a free base,” he said later. “But 1.3 is pushing it. And anything lower, I have to make sure I have the perfect jump.”Throughout the next at-bat, Tatum varied his leads and faked a move toward second, forcing the pitcher to step off the mound — the first disengagement. Two pitches later, a pickoff attempt: unsuccessful. That was the second disengagement. Everybody on the field seemed to know what was coming next. By rule, a third disengagement by the pitcher would have to result in a successful pickoff or else Tatum would be awarded second base via a balk.“If the pitch clock is ticking down and you know [the pitcher] can’t throw over,” Tatum said, “you can basically just have the base. It’s a free stolen base every time.”Sure enough, Tatum took off on the next pitch, with a 2-2 count, and had the base easily stolen — except that the batter swung through the fastball for strike three, ending the inning. Instead of standing on second and turning his attention toward stealing third, Tatum brushed the dirt off his uniform and prepared to head out to center field.The stolen base had been dying a slow and steady death for decades, with two primary killers.The first was the growing influence of power pitching, with rising velocity and lab-designed breaking balls giving hitters little recourse except to match power with power and swing for the fences because teams were unlikely to score runs by stringing together singles against such nasty stuff. As home runs, walks and strikeouts rose in an increasingly all-or-nothing sport, almost everything else, from batting averages to sacrifice bunts to stolen bases, declined.The second factor was the rise of the analytics movement, with its guiding principle that the risk of losing one precious out was significantly higher — roughly three times, as measured in run-expectancy — than the reward of a successful steal of second. An 80 percent success rate on steals — or roughly the career rate of Henderson, the sport’s all-time stolen base king — became the accepted benchmark for whether it made sense to run. And because few players could steal at such a rate, few were allowed to try.“There’s a rule on this club. It’s okay if you get [the stolen base]. If you don’t, you got hell to pay,” then-Oakland Athletics third base coach Ron Washington explains to veteran Ray Durham near the end of “Moneyball,” Michael Lewis’s seminal 2003 book about the Billy Beane-era A’s and the rise of the analytics movement. “… Somebody on this team runs and gets his ass thrown out, and you got all kinds of gurus who tell you that you just took yourself out of the inning.”From the modern peak of 5,114 stolen base attempts in 1987, the numbers gradually dropped, bottoming out with just 2,924 in 2021 (not counting shortened seasons) — a 43 percent falloff. That same year, almost four decades after Henderson set the single-season record with 130 steals for the 1982 A’s, Turner led the National League with just 32.In announcing the 2023 rule changes in September, former Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs general manager Theo Epstein admitted “people like me” — data-obsessed executives looking to exploit every micro-efficiency in the name of winning — had largely driven the deterioration of the game’s aesthetics. “While it might have helped you win some more games, it didn’t necessarily change the game for the better for the fans in terms of the way the game is played on the field,” Epstein said.Taken as a whole, then, MLB’s new rules for 2023 are an attempt to inject back into the game some of what had been lost over the previous decades — with the stolen base receiving a singular focus. Baseball officials have said its focus groups and polling indicated fans wanted more action — and specifically stolen bases — back in the game.“Let’s give the fans more of what they like,” Epstein said, singling out “the running game.”It certainly gave a player such as Tatum more of what he likes. Before this year, he said, he felt stymied by the White Sox’s unwillingness to let him run, even complaining to a team official last summer. “Y’all aren’t letting me steal,” he said then. “That’s a big part of my game.”It was that same official who, during this year’s spring training, told Tatum the organization was giving him the green light for 2023 — and implored him to take advantage.“I feel I’m a hitter first,” Tatum said. “But if I don’t crush the ball — if I hit a dribbler up the third base line, I can turn that into a hit with my speed. And then steal second. So if I get on base with a walk or a bunt or a swinging bunt, I have a chance to turn that into a double. The new rules just allow me to play my complete game.”The math behind the stolen base has been more or less the same since Henderson’s days: A speedy base runner can go from reacting to a pitcher’s first move to touching second base in about 3.3 seconds. A pitcher who is quick to the plate can get the ball to his catcher in about 1.3 seconds. A catcher with a good arm and solid mechanics can get the ball from his mitt to the second base bag in about 2.0.The fact that 1.3 plus 2.0 equals 3.3 — a dead tie — is what makes the stolen base such a daring and beautiful act of athleticism. It was also one of the things that made baseball great. Put a runner on first who is a tick faster than 3.3 seconds and a catcher behind the plate who is sub-2.0 — Henderson against Iván “Pudge” Rodriguez, say — and you had one of the great individual matchups in the sport, the anticipation rising with every pitch.But in a sport such as baseball, with its many intricacies and nuances, even the smallest changes — such as tilting the base-stealing dynamic ever so slightly in the direction of the runner — are bound to have significant downstream effects, including assigning additional value to players with certain skill sets.It won’t be enough to turn a one-tool prospect into a future MLB star, especially when the baseline for adding extra value in a sport with more stolen bases across the board only will rise.But take a player with exceptional speed who is also a solid and improving defensive center fielder and a hitter with sneaky power and excellent strike-zone awareness who has gotten on base in both college and minor league ball at a clip of .400-plus — a player such as Tatum — and it can be a game changer. Maybe he gets to the big leagues sooner. Maybe he sticks longer. Maybe he has a chance to be a regular instead of a role player or a star instead of a platoon guy.“There’s going to be some change” in how teams value players, said Chris Getz, who played seven years in the majors and is now the White Sox’s assistant general manager for player development. “Perhaps the 26th man [on a roster] might look differently this year as in years past. It’s going to affect transactions as well. It might factor into who you’re going to add, a call-up or trade acquisition, knowing that speed could be a real weapon for the club.“When it comes to the future projection of players, I could see the run tool being weighted differently than it was two years ago. And I think this has the chance to elongate the careers of certain players.”But as with every small change to the offensive side of baseball, there is an opposite effect on the defensive side. When it comes to run prevention and specifically stopping the opponent from stealing bases, the task has grown substantially more difficult.Already, there is anecdotal evidence the new rules are affecting reliever usage late in games, with Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts acknowledging, “If you don’t have the ability to manage the running game, then you’re not a viable option to come into an inning with runners on base.”The game is already different. On April 29, the Dodgers won a 1-0 game over the St. Louis Cardinals with the only run scoring in the second inning on a single, a stolen base and another single — the type of small-ball rally that had nearly gone extinct by the end of 2022.“It’s stuff we’re thinking about and talking about all the time,” said Josh Byrnes, the Dodgers’ senior vice president of baseball operations. “I remember this spring, [pitching coach] Mark Prior told our pitchers, ‘Okay, fellas, everyone needs to be 1.3 [seconds] or faster to the plate now.’ You haven’t had to spend as much energy on that in the past, but now you do. It’s in your face. If you’re not on point, they’re going to run wild on you.”Byrnes predicted such conversations would filter down to the draft, perhaps altering the way teams value certain tools in making their picks.“These are topics we haven’t had to discuss in a long time,” he said. “Trying to steal bases and defend the stolen base are bigger parts of the game now, and that affects player-personnel decisions. Even in the draft, guys who are above-average runners are going to be more prominent. Catchers with the ability to throw out runners are going to be more prominent. There are players who all of a sudden are better major league prospects in today’s atmosphere.”One of those prospects, it stands to reason, is Tatum. Drafted by the White Sox in the 16th round in 2021, he has never been considered a phenom. In MLB.com’s recent list of the White Sox’s top prospects, he ranked just 25th. Baseball America rated him 24th. FanGraphs’ list was 26-deep and did not include Tatum.Tatum said he had been given a season-long green light only once before in his career: as a junior at N.C. State in 2020. That year, in a season shortened by the pandemic, he went 7 for 7 in stolen base attempts.He still has fewer than 100 games and 400 plate appearances as a professional, largely the result of a positive test for an amphetamine last year that resulted in a 50-game suspension, plus an ankle injury that cut short his stint in the Arizona Fall League.The sudden boost to his career, in the form of a rule change that works in his favor, came at the perfect time.“For me, Tatum is a guy who can run on 1.3,” said White Sox field coordinator Doug Sisson, speaking of an opposing pitcher’s time to home plate. Part of Sisson’s job is working with the White Sox’s minor leaguers on the intricacies of base running. “If you face teams that are really good at shutting down the running game, teams where every pitcher is 1.2, you may not see us run for a few games. You can’t outrun the ball, and you can’t outrun the stopwatch.”One recent afternoon at Truist Stadium, Sisson worked with Tatum and the other Dash position players on ancillary (or secondary) leads — the initial movements toward second base that a runner takes just as the pitcher commits to delivering the pitch.“The advantage of getting a good ancillary lead is to try to get two disengagements early in the at-bat,” Sisson said. “Because then you’re off to the races.”It is one more subtle way in which the game has tilted in favor of the base runner. Because pickoff throws are now a finite quantity thanks to the disengagement rule, there is now an incentive for a base runner to rattle the pitcher in hopes of drawing a throw over. It happens to be something for which Tatum has shown some aptitude.“This is a guy who has major league tools,” Sisson said. “He’s going to be a good major league player.”",

      "title": "Perspective | Chaos has arrived in the NBA playoffs, and it might not be a fad",
      "text": "The NBA postseason, which progresses each spring alongside the capricious Stanley Cup playoffs, has always been the dependable tournament. Or the boring one. The drama of American pro basketball necessitates an obsession with stardom over the shock of unpredictability. It’s the reality television of sporting competitions. For proof, look at all the Kardashians in the arena.The game is starting to smash convention now, however. By NBA standards, this conference final round is buck wild. It is historic in its parity: A No. 7 seed in the West and a No. 8 seed in the East have advanced out of the play-in tournament, beating the past two champions along the way. During its 77 seasons, the league has seen random teams scatter surprise runs across all the rampant normative behavior. But until now, it hadn’t watched two teams seeded this low tear through the same playoffs.And they’re not just any underdogs. In fact, we should ban all dark horse descriptions. The Los Angeles Lakers, with a 38-year-old LeBron James and a (somewhat) healthy Anthony Davis, have risen from the 43-39 seventh seed to legitimate title contenders. And the Miami Heat, which has become a model franchise with its iron-willed culture, is a 44-38 eighth seed led by the indomitable Jimmy Butler. Both teams have too much top-end talent and savvy to dismiss.Candace Buckner: The Miami Heat’s MVP may be its coach, Erik SpoelstraThe Denver Nuggets, the top team in the West all season, are the lone No. 1 seed remaining. The Boston Celtics are a No. 2 seed that should be respected as a No. 1 because they have a lengthy playoff history despite their youth. But even though they made it to the Finals last season, the Celtics don’t look like an overwhelming favorite, not after needing six games to discard the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and coming back from a 3-2 deficit to beat the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games.In a league that flourishes by playing the hits, the NBA has found a different kind of familiarity this time. The conference finals might as well be dubbed Bubble Redux because Boston-Miami and Denver-Los Angeles hark back to the sport’s oddly enthralling pandemic expedition to Disney World. But this is neither an old story with new packaging nor evidence to forcefully discredit the asinine notion that the bubble playoffs were a fluke.This postseason provides the strongest confirmation that this new day of NBA parity is sustainable. For the last couple of seasons, I’ve often characterized it as an intermission before the next superpower emerges. But it feels more significant than that. It’s starting to look like an era of hyper competitiveness.What to know about the 2023 NBA playoffs (scores and schedule)If the Lakers don’t win it all, the NBA will crown a different champion for the fifth straight season. And even if the Lakers do take a confetti shower, they’re hardly the same team that triumphed in the bubble three years ago. They have a new coach in Darvin Ham. James and Davis are the only holdovers from that title team. Put all four teams together, and there are just 14 bubble players (not counting injured Heat guard Tyler Herro) who will factor into the outcome this time.The NBA has long been a transient league. But for the decade after James made “The Decision” to form a Big Three in Miami, the motivation behind a lot of the movement was to stack superstars on high-profile teams. The players considered it empowerment. The teams considered it an arms race. Then Kawhi Leonard was traded to Toronto, and the Raptors ended the Kevin Durant variant of the Golden State Warriors’ dynasty as Durant and Klay Thompson suffered devastating injuries in the 2019 Finals. That summer, Leonard joined the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency, and Durant chose an ill-fated alliance with Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets. In addition, Butler signed with Miami instead of remaining with a young 76ers core of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. All of a sudden, the NBA had exited an era of super teams and three-star alliances, rebalancing the sport.Since then, every effort to supercharge a contender has proved futile. The Nets traded a good amount of their depth to build a championship team around Durant, Irving and James Harden. It failed, as did the Lakers’ attempt to put Russell Westbrook with James and Davis. The Phoenix Suns have a pending experiment with Durant, Devin Booker and Chris Paul. But they just lost in the second round to the well-rounded Nuggets, and with decisions to make about the 38-year-old Paul and expensive, ill-fitting young center Deandre Ayton, the Suns need to prioritize role players over headliners.Parity might not be a fad. In July, a new collective bargaining agreement takes effect, and it comes with all sorts of legislation that will limit the opportunities teams with high payrolls have to add talent. Great teams will figure out ways to prosper in the new system, but windows of contention will be tighter. Smart drafting and player development will be essential. The old inclination to clear out contracts and allow superstars to join forces — which doesn’t really work unless Pat Riley is orchestrating it all — will be thorny with reduced availability of salary-cap exceptions for teams well over the cap.Which NBA lottery team needs Victor Wembanyama the most?The NBA is almost halfway through a period reminiscent of the 1970s, when eight teams won championships. But this time may be even crazier because the regular season — full of major injuries as well as ailing or aging players involved in dreaded load management plans — is becoming as much about survival as performance.The 2016-17 Warriors, who went 67-15 in their first season with Durant, are the last team with the NBA’s best regular season record to win the Larry O’Brien Trophy. In the past six regular seasons, the best team hasn’t made it to the championship round. The last four haven’t even advanced to the conference finals. Furthermore, teams led by the past four league MVPs have been bounced in the first or second round. Stephen Curry, way back in 2015, is the last MVP to end the season hugging the championship trophy.The MVP award isn’t a pre-title coronation anymore. And the team most equipped to win in the playoffs rarely dominates the regular season now. Volatility is taking over the sport, and if it continues it will either change the way we judge success or — more likely — cause yearly volcanic reactions when greatness vanishes too soon.Whether it creates a better league depends on the characters navigating change. But it’s an inevitable reality that may be more difficult to break than past systems. Get used to the parity. In the NBA, fickle is the future.",

      "title": "Commanders begin rookie minicamp with new vibes from top to bottom",
      "text": "If anything, the Commanders’ rookie class of 2023 received an introduction like no other in recent years.Less than an hour after the team’s drafted rookies, signed college free agents and tryout players walked off the practice field in Ashburn, news broke of an exclusive agreement between Daniel Snyder and a group led by Josh Harris to purchase the Commanders.The rookies could begin their careers with Harris as their owner should the agreement be ratified before the regular season.But to get there, they have to make it through a grueling couple of days of practice, followed by the continuation of organized team activities with veteran players next week.After hiring Eric Bieniemy as its offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, Washington not only restructured its offensive coaching staff (the team hasn’t announced new titles yet) but also revised its day-to-day operations. Bieniemy brought over some things from his time with the Kansas City Chiefs working under Coach Andy Reid.“I’d been in the same system doing things a specific way, and I felt the shake-up is good and it’s good for me as well,” Commanders Coach Ron Rivera said. “It is a whole different approach. One of the things that [Bieniemy] did differently, and I think that he adapted a little bit of what they had done in Kansas City under Andy … [was] we [changed] the way the offensive coaching staff is going to be structured. We’ve moved some guys around over a couple of positions so they can help the younger coaches that we’ve elevated as well. And a big part of it is, for EB, it gives him channels of communication.”Bieniemy also has the staff on a different regimen. Offensive coaches start their days at 7 a.m. and “go through everything,” Rivera said.The Commanders turned up the intensity at rookie camp on purpose: They want to see how the prospects handle an overload of information. How quickly do they grasp the system? How well can they apply the classroom teachings to the field?“Hopefully it’ll be one of those things that the guys, their retention is very good,” Rivera said. “They’ll be able to re-adapt and assimilate to how we’re doing it.”First-round pick Emmanuel Forbes, whom the team listed at 173 pounds, wasted little time in getting his first interception of practice. The former Mississippi State cornerback picked off Tim DeMorat, a free agent signing out of Fordham, on a pass intended for wide receiver Kyric McGowan during seven-on-seven drills. Forbes later broke up a pass during 11-on-11 action.The Commanders invited 35 players to try out during rookie camp — another offseason change in which Bieniemy had a hand.“Well, what we wanted to do was we wanted to have basically two full units, offensive and defensive,” Rivera said. “ … We felt being able to get a lot of work for the coaches as well was going be important, and it was also one of the things that Eric really felt strongly about doing.”One tryout player who made an impression was Jadakis Bonds, a 6-foot-4 wide receiver from Hampton University. Bonds pulled in a catch in tight coverage on a deep ball and used his size to create separation. He could be a candidate to fill the void left by Cam Sims, who signed with the Las Vegas Raiders in free agency.And, yes, he was named after the rapper “Jadakiss.”“My aunt actually named me that,” Bonds said.Bonds was one of five tryout players from historically Black colleges and universities. A sixth, former Bowie State defensive end Joshua Pryor, signed as a college free agent.“If you can play, they’re going to find you,” Bonds said. “ … We were able to come out here and showcase our HBCU talent and show what HBCUs can do.”One college free agent to follow: Kazmeir Allen, a wide receiver/returner out of UCLA. Allen played multiple positions in UCLA’s offense and returned punts and kickoffs.“He’s a young man that most certainly has gotten our attention, and he’s a young guy that we went out and tried to make sure we were able to recruit and bring him in as a free agent,” Rivera said.Rivera had a tempered reaction to the Commanders’ 2023 schedule, which includes a Week 14 bye, only one prime-time game and a Thanksgiving game in Dallas. The holiday meeting will be the Commanders’ 11th all-time, and their first since they beat the Cowboys, 41-16, in 2020.“It’s all right,” Rivera said of the schedule. “It’ll be fun to have the Thanksgiving game again. That’s kind of cool, and other than that I wish the bye might have been a little bit sooner, but again, we’ll take it where it is.”Three of the Commanders’ draft picks — fifth-round defensive end K.J. Henry, sixth-round running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. and seventh-round defensive end Andre Jones — signed their rookie contracts Friday. All 12 of the team’s undrafted free agents also passed their physicals and signed their contracts.Second-round safety Quan Martin was excused for rookie minicamp to tend to a family matter. He is expected to join the team for the next phase of OTAs.The Commanders released wide receiver Alex Erickson and linebacker Drew White to get to 90 players on their roster.",

      "title": "Analysis | Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray are winning battle of stars against Lakers",
      "text": "DENVER — Nikola Jokic hasn’t gotten the call from Hollywood to front a “Space Jam” remake, his No. 15 jersey wasn’t among the NBA’s 10 best sellers this season, and he doesn’t have an Instagram account, let alone a signature sneaker. His sidekick, Jamal Murray, has watched the first seven years of his career go by without an all-star selection or any other major individual honor since he was named all-rookie back in 2017. Well, second-team all-rookie.In terms of championship rings, awards, social media influence, global marketing footprint or any of the other metrics used to judge modern basketball players, the Denver Nuggets’ duo are dwarfed by the Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James and Anthony Davis. But past glory and pure fame haven’t mattered at all in the Western Conference finals as Jokic and Murray have thoroughly outshined the Lakers’ stars to lead the Nuggets to a 2-0 series lead entering Saturday’s Game 3 in Los Angeles.In a Game 1 win Tuesday, Jokic compiled a preposterous 34-point, 21-rebound, 14-assist triple-double to outduel Davis, who finished with a game-high 40 points and 10 rebounds, and hold off a Lakers rally. Then, after a choppy start in Thursday’s Game 2, Murray scored 23 of his game-high 37 points in the fourth quarter as Denver came back from an 11-point deficit to claim a 108-103 win at Ball Arena.Nikola Jokic is now, Victor Wembanyama is next and the NBA is worldwideAfter the Nuggets outlasted James and Davis, who both showed signs of fatigue under heavy minutes, Coach Michael Malone chided the media for underselling Jokic, Murray and their well-rounded supporting cast.“You win Game 1, and all everybody talked about was the Lakers,” Malone said. “Let’s be honest, the national narrative was: ‘Hey, the Lakers are fine. They’re down 1-0, but they figured something out.’ . . . The narrative wasn’t about the Nuggets. The narrative wasn’t about Nikola. The narrative was about the Lakers and their adjustments. You put that in your pipe, you smoke it. You come back, and you know what, we’re going to go up 2-0.”Despite Malone’s huff and gruff, the Nuggets aren’t a ragtag group of anonymous upstarts: Jokic is a brilliant two-time MVP who guided the Western Conference’s No. 1 seed to 53 wins. Though Denver has never reached the Finals since it joined the NBA from the ABA in 1976, it is engaged in a rematch of the 2020 West finals, which Los Angeles took in five games. The Nuggets boast better balance and more experience this time around: They have won six playoff series over the past five years, including a strong second-round showing against Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns.Jokic, 28, has been the rock, compiling seven triple-doubles in Denver’s 13 postseason games. His deft scoring touch, unmatched vision for a center and physical rebounding presence have flustered opponents, and he has shown significant improvement on the defensive end compared with his previous postseason runs.The 26-year-old Murray has been the X-factor: Denver has gone 5-1 when he scores 30 or more points, including a closeout win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round and 31 points in Game 1 against the Lakers.Nothing was falling for Murray early in Game 2. He shot just 5 for 17 from the field through three quarters and clapped his hands in frustration after several misses. But Murray found his touch in the fourth quarter with a pull-up jumper with 10 minutes remaining before proceeding to hit four three-pointers, including a deep one over James, to put the Nuggets in control.“[Murray] got a little midrange pull-up to go in and kind of looked up to the heavens,” Malone said. “That’s all he needs, and after that he’s shooting into a hula hoop.”Jamal Murray goes OFF in the 4th quarter to help Denver secure a 2-0 lead in the WCF!37 PTS (23 PTS in the 4Q)10 REB6 3PMDEN/LAL Game 2: Sat, 8:30 PM ET | ABC pic.twitter.com/wZ9k5YaUCaFor Murray, who didn’t appear in a game from April 2021 to October 2022 because of a torn ACL in his left knee, this series has served as a grand reintroduction to millions of playoff viewers. The Canadian guard, who first displayed his knack for clutch scoring during Denver’s run to the West finals in the 2020 bubble, iced the Game 2 win with a midrange jumper and seven closing free throws.“[Murray] had his midrange game going, and he had his three-point shot going in the fourth,” James said. “It’s no surprise to anybody. He’s done it before. Only one of [Denver’s threes] was uncontested. All of them were great contests. Two of Jamal’s threes was right in the face of me and [Davis]. The three-point line is what killed us in the fourth, but I didn’t see many [defensive] breakdowns.”Though the Nuggets can’t match the Lakers’ 17 championships or phalanx of celebrity fans, they represent excellent basketball foils. Jokic has been this postseason’s most dominant offensive player while leading the most efficient playoff offense; Davis, in turn, has been the postseason’s top defensive talent for the Lakers’ top-ranked defense.So far, Denver’s offense has won out, leaving Los Angeles looking worn out. James uncharacteristically missed an open-court dunk in Game 2, and he shot just 9 for 19 from the field in the loss. Legs appeared to be an issue for the 38-year-old forward, who repeatedly settled for jumpers after logging 40 minutes in Game 1. James has missed all 10 of his three-point attempts in the series.LeBron blew the dunk 😅 pic.twitter.com/bRvv3lGYGhDavis faded in similar fashion, finishing with 18 points on 4-for-15 shooting and repeatedly struggling to get anything going when Jokic defended him. In the fourth quarter, Davis committed three turnovers and missed two three-point attempts in the closing minutes.The Lakers overhauled their roster at the trade deadline with the intention of giving James and Davis enough help to mount a late-season push into the playoffs. The plan worked better than most expected; newcomers Rui Hachimura, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt have played key roles at various moments of the postseason.What to know about the 2023 NBA playoffs (scores and schedule)Now that James and Davis are facing the first 0-2 series hole of their Lakers’ tenures, the two stars must drive the turnaround effort. James’s scoring efficiency must improve with more free throw attempts, drives and better outside shooting, while Davis must score more consistently, while still carrying his typically heavy load defensively, to offset Jokic’s wide-ranging impact. Both James and Davis must display better focus and assertiveness in late-game moments once the series shifts to Los Angeles, where the Lakers are 6-0 during the postseason.Entering the West finals, continuity appeared to be the Nuggets’ chief advantage over the new-look Lakers. While that has proved accurate, Denver’s headliners have simply outperformed their better-known Los Angeles counterparts, too.“The outside noise is the outside noise,” Murray said when asked about Denver getting overlooked. “We’re used to that. Even when we win, they talk about the other team. We beat the [Los Angeles] Clippers in the bubble, and they talked about the other team. Same old, same old. It fuels us a little more, and it will be sweeter when we win the [championship].”Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox",

      "title": "Perspective | The Heat is no ordinary No. 8 seed, and the Celtics are paying for it",
      "text": "BOSTON — From now on, let’s forget about the whole eighth-seed business. Toss it out. Consider it an unfortunate typo discovered in the NBA playoffs bracket. Or just an arbitrary digit there for window dressing.It now feels like an insult to attach that number to the Miami Heat.Eighth seeds don’t play like this team. They don’t invade a notoriously loud and hostile arena, pillaging away home court and leaving the locals in white and green stunned and silenced. They don’t overcome a 12-point deficit in the fourth quarter, then hold their opponent — the one with a pair of all-NBA stars — to just two field goals in the last six minutes. They certainly don’t win the first pair of games in the Eastern Conference finals, performing like the tougher, better organized and more poised outfit that the higher seed only wishes it could be.On Friday night, Miami made another mockery of the East’s bracket, picking apart the second-seeded Boston Celtics for a 111-105 win. An eighth seed is approaching the doorstep of the NBA Finals, and reminding everyone that yes, numbers do lie. That number assigned to the Heat does not reflect the way this team should be viewed.“I don’t think we’ve ever considered ourselves an eight seed,” said Heat forward Caleb Martin, who poured in 25 points off the bench. “Obviously we put ourselves in that position through the regular season, but we always knew what we were capable of as a team. We have always had confidence in each other and great chemistry throughout the team. So we just knew we had to get here, and once we got here, things would play out in our favor.”Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray are winning battle of stars against LakersAs for the favorites, who had been picked to win the series, the Celtics folded when it mattered. Resembling their worst selves from last year’s run to the championship round, the Celtics are still prone to costly, late turnovers and they still operate in panicked sets — that’s if they try to run anything at all. Jayson Tatum missed his three field goal attempts in the fourth quarter. Jaylen Brown misfired on four of five shots, and as Boston tried to protect its vanishing lead, he committed a traveling turnover. Despite the experience the Celtics gained from going six games with the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 Finals, this is their second consecutive series in which they’ve fallen into a serious hole.“Just effort,” center Robert Williams III said. “Playing the right way the whole game, honestly, in my opinion. And trusting each other. We got to gain that trust and keep that trust throughout the whole game.”The Heat have not shown those same limitations in this series. They have a grown-up vibe about them. Even in the morning, when someone chooses the Isley Brothers then Teddy Pendergrass as background music while players get shots up. “Close the Door” might not be the typical pregame, get-hype tune for most NBA teams. For the Heat, however, it’s a slow jam that soothes, then provides subliminal instruction to put the Celtics to bed. Between the two teams, Miami looks like the veteran side ready to play in June.“We know what we’re capable of. We going to be in this thing until the end together, good, bad, indifferent,” said Butler, who played all but seven minutes Game 2 and scored 27 points. “We are who we are … and we are going to continue to fight together.”And so moving forward, those numbers in front of the team names — eight and two — should be reimagined.Eight could very well represent Miami’s aggression level. Boston’s registers at a measly two. Or: Eight, the number of points Heat center Bam Adebayo scored in the fourth quarter Friday night, as well as many rebounds he grabbed in the final frame.As Miami made its comeback, Adebayo showed little respect for Al Horford’s ability to defend him one-on-one, taking him to the paint and drawing two foul shots that trimmed the lead to 100-98 with 3:33 remaining. Then, inside the final minute, Adebayo cleaned up a missed shot by Butler with a putback dunk. A skilled yet powerful big man, Adebayo finished one assist shy of a triple-double with 22 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists.Inside the NBA draft lottery room: Heartbreak for the WizardsAlso, eight: The number of memes “Mad Jimmy” created any time Boston backup Grant Williams attempted to challenge him.Martin bestowed this latest nickname on his teammate, inspired by the testy fourth-quarter exchange between Butler and Williams. Though postgame, Butler expressed admiration for Williams, who logged a surprising 26 minutes after collecting a DNP in Game 1, he showed nothing but disdain after scoring over him, which led to a confrontation in which the two men shouted at one another, forehead to forehead.“That’s just competition at its finest. He hit a big shot. Started talking to me; I like that. I’m all for that. It makes me key in a lot more,” Butler said. “It makes me smile. It does. When people talk to me, I’m like: ‘Okay, I know I’m a decent player, if you want to talk to me out of everybody that you can talk to.’ But it’s just competition. I do respect him, though. He’s a big part of what they try to do. He switches. He can shoot the ball. I just don’t know if I’m the best person to talk to.”When their foreheads touched, Boston led 96-87 with 6:22 to play. The Heat closed the game on a 24-9 run. Never talk to “Mad Jimmy.”“I knew that you could kind of see it in his eyes that he was ready to go after that,” Martin said. “He leads, we follow. He makes it easy on all of us.”Now, strictly for the record, this sentence has to be written: The eighth-seeded Heat took a two games-to-none lead in the conference finals. Beginning Sunday, when the series moves to Miami for Games 3 and 4, the Heat will have a chance to do the improbable and sweep the second seed. Improbable because this very Miami roster needed to survive the play-in tournament just to secure the final spot in the postseason. That experience, as well as a rocky regular season, must have created this eighth-seeded monster.“Feels like this has just been our existence all year long. I guess nobody is really paying attention,” Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Every single game, it felt like for weeks on end, every game was ending on the last-second shot, whether we’re shooting it or the other team is shooting it. So you develop some grit from that. Whether that turns into confidence or not, sometimes you don’t have the confidence. But at least you have that experience of going through stuff and you understand how tough it is.”",

      "title": "Perspective | The Wizards and Knicks GM Scott Perry: An ideal fit hiding in plain sight",
      "text": "The Washington Wizards need a general manager, and a few prayers also wouldn’t hurt. Once mired in mediocrity, they can’t even get past the bouncer now. Operating under an owner’s playoff mandate, they’ve endured five straight losing seasons, failing to be a postseason stowaway in four of them.If rebuilding is tough to stomach, how do you describe the indigestion of aimless losing? Their insufficient attempts to win have led to a farcical squandering of five years that could have been spent resetting the roster with better young talent, an abundance of future assets and ideal salary cap flexibility.And guess what? They could actually be winning now and holding leverage to build a stronger contender with the NBA bracing for a wild couple of offseasons as franchises adjust to parity-driven wrinkles in the new collective bargaining agreement.The Wizards aren’t seeking a new executive to lead their basketball operations simply out of a desire to win. Owner Ted Leonsis is on the hunt because the organization doesn’t know how to. Any blurry vision the Wizards have of steady, perennial contention — and we’re talking a much higher level than the John Wall-Bradley Beal era — requires an executive with the kind of team-building dexterity the franchise hasn’t seen since its 1970s heyday.As the playoffs progress without them, the Wizards are at the beginning phase of their process to replace Tommy Sheppard. They have a fluid list of candidates, and The Washington Post reported two intriguing executives who have had exploratory talks with the Wizards: Trajan Langdon, the New Orleans GM who is second to David Griffin on the Pelicans’ organizational chart, and Milwaukee Bucks assistant GM Milt Newton.Buckner: For the long-patient Ted Leonsis, finally a Ted Talk to rememberTim Connelly, the president of the Minnesota Timberwolves and a Baltimore native who turned down the Wizards four years ago, is considered a possibility again, even though he’s just one year into a deal that pays him $8 million per season. Golden State’s Bob Myers, who could be a free agent soon, will be every needy team’s dream for as long as he’s available.But considering the Wizards’ situation, there’s an ideal fit who should be among those pursued by Leonsis: New York Knicks GM Scott Perry. After Sheppard was fired, Post beat writer Ava Wallace mentioned Perry following conversations with people from around the league. Over the past few weeks, I’ve also asked around about what Washington should do, and Perry is consistently among the first names mentioned.Why? The reasons are as layered as the Wizards’ problems. Perry, 59, has spent the past 23 years developing a reputation as a multidimensional talent evaluator capable of matching the right players to a team’s identity, a versatile thinker who doesn’t view the task as merely contending or rebuilding and a connector with the skill set and personality to lead and be the glue for an organization.Those happen to be the Wizards’ three most essential needs. This roster, a collection of spare parts around Beal, has no identity. Leonsis, always methodical, has begun his search with an open mind but is unlikely to be moved by candidates who prefer a teardown — especially if they can’t envision other fruitful paths. The front office needs a shift in culture and a boost in spirit after what several holdovers have portrayed as a tense and sometimes coarse work environment over the past few years.Similar to Langdon, Perry could be enticed by the opportunity to be the top basketball executive. It took until 2017, when New York called, for Perry to be given true No. 1 responsibilities. But in 2020, the Knicks fired team president Steve Mills and later replaced him with former agent Leon Rose, who oversees basketball operations. Perry and Rose have worked well together. The Knicks, in the middle of a conference semifinal series against the Miami Heat, have made the playoffs in two of the past three seasons. They have a solid and fiscally responsible roster, with Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle providing all-star-caliber production on tolerable contracts. They have the trade assets and flexibility to go fishing for a superstar if the right one becomes available. Instead of relying on their brand and their city as the only attractions, the Knicks are starting to look desirable for their competence.What to know about the 2023 NBA playoffs (scores and schedule)That’s the Perry effect, even when he doesn’t have final say. He did some of his best work with Joe Dumars in Detroit, helping to shape a roster full of underappreciated, tough and unselfish pros who made six straight Eastern Conference finals and won a title in 2004 over a Los Angeles Lakers team featuring Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Gary Payton. He spent a year with the Seattle SuperSonics before the team relocated to Oklahoma City, helping Sam Presti with a draft that included snagging Kevin Durant and trading Ray Allen to start a rebuild that propelled the organization to a long run of contention.Perry also has worked for Orlando and Sacramento. He was with the Kings for just three months before the Knicks offered that dream opportunity, but during that short tenure he was critical to a formative offseason that included drafting De’Aaron Fox, who has blossomed into the franchise player of a promising young team.Leonsis knows the Wizards need a fresh approach. They also need a new vibe. Those initial talks with Langdon and Newton should help crystallize what’s possible. Perry is just as worthy of consideration.Leonsis famously declared that he spoke with 78 leaders from sports, business and politics before making several hires and restructuring the Wizards four years ago. Well, that was a fun exercise. Now they’re on to the next thing. To replace Sheppard, the process will be streamlined, and it needs to be fast with the June 22 draft approaching. It needs to find someone who can marry long-standing knowledge of NBA team building with current best practices, all while mixing in the agility to maneuver swiftly should franchises react erratically before luxury tax penalties become more punitive.Over the past five seasons, the Wizards have gone 161-229, a .413 winning percentage. That’s basically the equivalent of a 34-48 record every year, almost tank-level bad without the benefits of tanking. The Wizards haven’t drafted higher than ninth during this period. They’re probably picking in that same territory in this draft; they have the eighth-best odds to land the No. 1 pick in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.This is how stuck they are: In 2018-19, the Wizards went 32-50, making them one of 14 teams to win fewer than 40 games. Nine of those 14 teams made the playoffs this season. The Wizards went 35-47.Trying to lose is unethical. But trying to win this way — with Beal on a $250 million deal with a no-trade clause, Kristaps Porzingis making more than $30 million per season and ready for an extension and free agent Kyle Kuzma probably seeking $25 million annually — is absurd. The Wizards are desperate for someone with an itemized plan for success.When Perry came to the NBA in 2000, Dumars was recasting a 32-50 team still reeling after losing Grant Hill in free agency. A year later, the Pistons won 50 games and started a streak of eight straight playoff appearances. It was a run in which Dumars and his front office nailed almost every decision.That’s the environment into which Perry was born, and everywhere he has been, he has shown portions of that team-building acuity. It leaves you wondering what he could do with full control over a substantial period of time. The Wizards would be wise to find out.",

      "title": "Nationals’ bats stay (mostly) quiet as Marlins complete series sweep",
      "text": "MIAMI — The Washington Nationals knew entering the season that their margin for error was small. Forty-four games into the campaign, it only has grown more apparent.Each game of this three-game series in Miami was decided by two runs or fewer. And the Nationals found themselves on the wrong end of all three, with the Marlins completing the sweep by handing the Nationals a 5-3 loss Thursday at LoanDepot Park.“Tough game,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “ … We just didn’t hit enough this series. I thought we pitched pretty good. Just the bats got cold on us, so we got to come back and start swinging the bats.”The Nationals (18-26), as they have so many times this season, came to life in the late innings. Jeimer Candelario and Corey Dickerson both collected RBI hits in the eighth inning to trim Washington’s deficit to 4-3. Candelario stood at second base as the tying run when Keibert Ruiz chased a change-up on the first pitch of his at-bat and grounded into a double play to end the threat.Josiah Gray's new cutter has been a big helpEarly in the game, the Nationals limited their chases against Eury Pérez, one of the Marlins’ top prospects making his second career start. Pérez, 20, showed his talent Thursday but also a bit of wildness.Still, Pérez benefited from a few borderline called strikes, and the Nationals were unable to get to him. A big missed chance came when CJ Abrams struck out with a pair of runners on in the second; Abrams finished the series 0 for 11 with eight strikeouts.The Marlins (23-21) took an early lead when Trevor Williams allowed a second-inning home run to Bryan De La Cruz. Williams left a 1-2 fastball up, and De La Cruz hammered it 402 feet to dead center. Williams then gave up an RBI single to Jean Segura in the third, followed by another to Xavier Edwards in the fourth, and Miami led 3-1.Pérez tossed five innings, and his lone mistake was Candelario’s home run in the fourth. Candelario was one of the few bright spots offensively for the Nationals in the series, going 8 for 11. His batting average jumped from .219 to .253 in the three-game set.“Making good contact, trying to have good [at-bats],” Candelario said. “I want to be able to be in a good position to help my team win, and I got to keep working really hard to keep doing what I’m doing.”Jake Irvin is an outlier for the Nationals. Here's why.Candelario was one of three veterans signed this past offseason to hit in the middle of Washington’s order, joining Dominic Smith and Dickerson. Candelario leads the team in doubles (12) and is tied for the lead in homers (five).Mason Thompson allowed a run in the seventh before the Nationals cut the deficit to one in the eighth. But Candelario’s throwing error in the eighth inning proved costly when De La Cruz reached first. Nick Fortes eventually drove him in with a two-out single off Erasmo Ramirez to give Miami a cushion. And the small details again seemed to come back to haunt the Nationals.“We made a crucial error there late, could’ve kept the game closer within a run,” Martinez said. “Those little things seem to bite us a little bit. So we just got to play good clean baseball. We always talk about 27 outs, moving the baseball.”Here’s what else to know about the Nationals’ loss:Cade Cavalli strolled into the visiting locker room in Miami on Thursday afternoon ahead of the series finale. Later on, he greeted teammates as they came in from the buses. Cavalli will travel with the team back to Washington for the weekend series to check in with doctors. Then he will return to West Palm Beach to continue rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.Cavalli is eight weeks removed from surgery. He’s no longer wearing a brace on his right arm, can straighten his arm and touch his right shoulder. Cavalli said the next step is to strengthen his forearm; his hand still feels tight, and he doesn’t have full flexibility.“Making [progress] with the range of motion, and arm’s feeling really good,” Cavalli said. “Hitting every check mark that needs to be hit, and we’re really happy with the progress. Being back here is amazing. As you guys can tell, I just feel like a new energy. I miss these guys a ton, so it’s great to be able to be around them and watch them play some ball.”The Nationals agreed to a minor league deal with Franmil Reyes on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the situation. Reyes has two opt-outs, on June 16 and July 1, according to another source familiar with the details of the contract.Reyes started the season with the Kansas City Royals, with who he hit .186 in 19 games before being designated for assignment May 8. Reyes has 108 career home runs. If he is eventually called up, Reyes could provide power to a lineup that has just 29 home runs — more than just one other team (Cleveland).",
